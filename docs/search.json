In applied research, we often need to make predictions. In applied land economics research, prediction is crucial—whether forecasting property values, estimating rental yields, or projecting land use changes. This lab equips you with the tools to make robust predictions and quantify their uncertainty. Let’s begin with the basic prediction workflow.\nOnce we have estimated our regression coefficients \\(b_1\\) (intercept) and \\(b_2\\) (slope), we can use them to predict food expenditure for any given income level using the fitted regression equation (Eq. 2).\n\\[\n\\hat{y} = b_1 + b_2 x \\tag{2}\n\\]\n⚠️Unit conversion: In the following R script “income = $2000” is “income = 20” (the data is in hundreds of dollars).\n\n#### Step 1: Fit the model (recap from Lab 7)\n\nlibrary(PoEdata)\ndata(\"food\")\n\n# Estimate the food expenditure model\nmod1 &lt;- lm(food_exp ~ income, data = food)\n\n# Review estimates\nsummary(mod1)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = food_exp ~ income, data = food)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-223.025  -50.816   -6.324   67.879  212.044 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

A fitted model object (mod1)\n#   2. A data frame with new x-values (must have same column names as original data)\nyhat &lt;- predict(mod1, newx)\n\n# Give friendly names to each prediction so the output is   easy to read\nnames(yhat) &lt;- c(\"Low income = $2000\", \"Median income = $2500\", \"High income = $2700\")\n\n# Show the predictions\nyhat\n\n   Low income = $2000 Median income = $2500   High income = $2700 \n             287.6089              338.6571              359.0764 \n\n#### Step 4: Interpret the results\n\n# A household earning $2,000/week is predicted to spend $287.60 on food per week.\n# This represents about 14.4% of their income (287.6/2000).\n\n# For the median household ($2,500/week), predicted food expenditure is $338.70,\n# or about 13.5% of income.\n\n# Observation: The proportion of income spent on food decreases as income rises—\n# this is consistent with Engel's Law from economics.\n\nWhat’s Missing? Uncertainty!\nThese are point predictions—our single best guess at each income level. But how confident are we?\nConsider the household earning $2,000/week: - We predict they’ll spend $287.60 on food - But there’s sampling uncertainty (our \\(b_1\\) and \\(b_2\\) are estimates) - And individual variation (not all $2,000/week households spend exactly $287.60)\nTwo types of intervals address these concerns:\n\nConfidence intervals answer: “What’s the average food expenditure for all households at this income level?”\nPrediction intervals answer: “What might one specific household at this income level spend?”\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding Prediction Uncertainty Through Sampling Variability\nOur predictions depend entirely on our estimated coefficients (\\(b_1, b_2\\)). But these are sample estimates—if we collected a different dataset, we’d get different values and therefore different predictions.\nBefore making predictions, it’s important to understand that our coefficient estimates vary across samples. This matters for land economics applications: if we’re advising on property valuations, we need to know how sensitive our predictions are to sampling variation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is “sampling with replacement”?\n\n\n\nImagine our 40 observations are numbered balls in an urn. We draw a ball, record its data, put it back, then draw again. Some observations may appear multiple times in a bootstrap sample; others not at all. This mimics the randomness of drawing a new sample from the population.\n\n\nThe following bootstrap exercise (simulating sampling variability) demonstrates this variability by repeatedly resampling our data and re-estimating the model:\n\nN &lt;- nrow(food)   # observations\nC &lt;- 50           # repeats\nS &lt;- 38           # subsample size\n\nsumb2 &lt;- 0        # sum of slopes\nfor (i in 1:C){\n  set.seed(3*i)   # reproducible\n  # Draw a bootstrap sample (with replacement)\n  subsample &lt;- food[sample(1:N, S, replace = TRUE), ]  # bootstrap draw\n  # Fit the model on this bootstrap sample\n  mod2 &lt;- lm(food_exp ~ income, data = subsample)      \n  sumb2 &lt;- sumb2 + coef(mod2)[2]                       # store slope β2\n}\n\nprint(sumb2 / C, digits = 3)   # average slope\n\nincome \n  9.89 \n\n\nCompare this bootsrap average (repeated samples) witht the original OLS regression output (from mod1) for \\(b_2\\). They should be similar, confirming that OLS is unbiased.\n\n\nEstimated Variances and Covariance of Coefficients\nThe variance-covariance matrix tells us two crucial things: 1. Variances (diagonal): How much each coefficient estimate varies 2. Covariances (off-diagonal): How the estimates move together\nThis matters for prediction because uncertainty in \\(\\hat{y}\\) depends on uncertainty in both coefficients and their correlation. For land valuation models, ignoring this covariance can lead to overconfident predictions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nCommon Error in Applied Work Many analysts incorrectly calculate prediction variance as just \\(\\text{Var}(b_1) + x_0^2 \\cdot \\text{Var}(b_2)\\), omitting the covariance term. This can make predictions appear less precise than they actually are.\n\n\nThe following R script extracts estimated variances and covariances from the object mod 1.\n\n# coef variance–covariance matrix.\n# This is a 2×2 symmetric matrix:\n# - Top-left (1884.44): Var(b₁), variance of intercept\n# - Bottom-right (4.38): Var(b₂), variance of slope  \n# - Off-diagonals (-87.78): Cov(b₁,b₂), covariance between coefficients\nvcov(mod1)                       \n\n            (Intercept)     income\n(Intercept)  1884.44226 -85.903157\nincome        -85.90316   4.381752\n\n#### Extract individual components\n(varb1   &lt;- vcov(mod1)[1, 1])        # Var(B1), intercept variance\n\n[1] 1884.442\n\n(varb2   &lt;- vcov(mod1)[2, 2])        # Var(B2), slope variance\n\n[1] 4.381752\n\n(covb1b2 &lt;- vcov(mod1)[1, 2])        # Cov(B1, B2), covariance\n\n[1] -85.90316\n\n\nHaving established how to assess coefficient stability, we now turn to cases where linear relationships are insufficient to capture real-world patterns in land markets.\n\n\nNon-Linear Relationships - When Straight Lines Don’t Fit\nIn practice, many land economic relationships are non-linear: - Property prices don’t increase linearly with size (diminishing returns to scale) - Land values may have threshold effects near transport nodes - Agricultural productivity often follows diminishing returns\nWe’ll explore two common approaches Quadratic Models and Log-Linear Models.\n\nPART A.

In Lab 8, we made predictions. But how do we know if our findings are statistically meaningful? Consider our food expenditure model:\nWe estimated that food spending increases by $10.21 for every $100 increase in income But is this effect real, or could it be due to random chance? Could the true effect actually be zero (no relationship)?\nHypothesis testing provides a formal framework to answer these questions.\n💡 Land Economics Application When valuing agricultural land, we might find that proximity to roads increases land value by £500 per meter. But before advising clients, we need to know: Is this effect statistically significant, or could it be sampling noise?\n\nPART A - Hypothesis Tests for Individual Coefficients\nWe start with two competing claims: \\[\nH_0: \\beta_k = c, \\qquad H_A: \\beta_k \\ne c.\n\\]\nTest statistic:\nUnder the null hypothesis, the test statistic follows a t-distribution: \\[\nt = \\frac{b_k - c}{\\operatorname{se}(b_k)},\\quad t \\sim t_{N-2}.\\tag{6}\n\\]\nwhere:\n\\(b_k\\)​ is our estimated coefficient\n\\(c\\) is the hypothesized value (zero in our case)\n\\(\\operatorname{se}(b_k)\\) is the standard error of \\(b_k\\)\n\\(N−K\\) is degrees of freedom (N observations, K parameters)\nIntuition: This ratio measures how many standard errors our estimate is away from the hypothesized value.\nExample 1: Two-Tailed Test (Is there any effect?) Question: Does income affect food expenditure?

Remember: the alternative hypothesis represents what you’re trying to find evidence for.\n\n\n\nPART B - The p‑Value Approach\nThe p-value represents the probability of observing a t-statistic as extreme as, or more extreme than, the one obtained from the sample, assuming the null hypothesis is true. In other words, it measures how compatible the data are with the null hypothesis. We reject the null hypothesis when the p-value is smaller than the chosen significance level (e.g., 0.05).\nFor a right-tailed test, the p-value corresponds to the area to the right of the calculated t-statistic. For a left-tailed test, it is the area to the left of the calculated t-statistic. For a two-tailed test, the total p-value is divided equally between both tails—p/2 in the left tail and p/2 in the right tail.\nIn R, p-values are obtained using the function pt(t, df), where t is the calculated t-ratio and df is the model’s degrees of freedom. For two-tailed tests, the result should be adjusted to account for both tails, typically using 2*(1 - pt(abs(t), df)).\nDecision rule: Reject \\(H_0\\)​ if \\(p-value&lt;αp\\) Fail to reject \\(H_0\\)​ if \\(p-value≥αp\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon Significance Levels\n\n\n\n\nα = 0.05 (most common): We’re willing to accept a 5% chance of incorrectly rejecting H₀\nα = 0.01 (more conservative): Only 1% chance of Type I error\nα = 0.10 (more lenient): Accept 10% chance of error\n\nThe smaller the p-value, the stronger the evidence against H₀\n\n\nComputing p-Values: \\(F_t\\) stands for the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the t-distribution.\nRight‑tail: \\(p = 1 - F_t(t)\\) (probability in the upper tail)\nLeft‑tail: \\(p = F_t(t)\\) (probability in the lower tail)\nTwo‑tail: \\(p = 2 * (1-F_t(|t|)\\) (probability in both tails)\nExample 1: Right-Tail Test Question: Is the marginal effect of income on food expenditure greater than $5.50?\n\\[H_0: \\beta_2 \\leq 5.5 \\quad \\text{vs} \\quad H_A: \\beta_2 &gt;
