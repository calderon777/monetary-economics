    "text": "1 Classical Theory of Money\nIntroduction The classical theory of money is an approach in macroeconomics asserting that money primarily influences nominal variables (prices, wages) and has negligible effect on real economic activity (output, employment) in the long run. Classical economists often say “money is a veil”, meaning that the system of money prices may obscure real economic relationships, but in reality the underlying real economy is unchanged by the quantity of money in circulation[1]. This theory, rooted in the 19th-century Walrasian general equilibrium framework and the early 20th-century Quantity Theory of Money, underpins the view that sustained changes in the money supply lead to proportional changes in the price level, with real variables determined by real factors like technology and preferences. In this reading, we outline the classical model of a monetary economy and its key implications – the Walrasian system of general equilibrium, the classical dichotomy between real and monetary sectors, the neutrality of money, the Cambridge equation of exchange, and the Quantity Theory of Money (QTM) – and discuss how these ideas hold up with contemporary examples. We also examine the limitations of the classical view, including situations (such as short-run economic fluctuations or extreme policy environments) where money may not be neutral and why modern economists and central banks have nuanced this theory. The Walrasian System of General Equilibrium (Real Economy) Classical theory builds on the Walrasian general equilibrium model of a barter economy (named after Léon Walras, 1834–1910, a pioneer of mathematical economics). In a Walrasian system, all markets for goods and services simultaneously clear through price adjustment. Formally, it consists of a set of market-clearing conditions (one for each good or factor) and a corresponding set of relative prices that adjust to equate supply and demand in every market[2]. Importantly, only relative prices matter in this system – prices are expressed in terms of one another (for instance, how many units of good A trade for one unit of good B). One good can be chosen as a numéraire (unit of account) to price all other goods, fixing the scale for relative prices. Because all prices in Walrasian equilibrium are determined only up to a common scale, the model exhibits homogeneity: if all prices were doubled (or halved), the real allocations of goods would remain the same. This implies that in a purely real economy without money, the absolute price level is indeterminate – there is no unique solution for “the” price level, only for relative prices. In other words, the Walrasian model determines what and how much gets produced and consumed (real output and relative price ratios), but not the overall monetary value of those goods. Walras’ Law holds that if all but one markets are in equilibrium, the last market must also clear (excess supply in one market must be matched by excess demand in at least one other), ensuring consistency of the general equilibrium[3][4]. In this frictionless, barter-style economy, real variables – such as real output, the allocation of goods, and relative prices – are determined entirely by real factors (preferences, endowments, technology) without any reference to the money supply. This is the foundation of the classical idea that money is nonessential in determining real economic outcomes. However, to analyze an economy with money (a monetary economy), we need to introduce money into the Walrasian system in a way that pins down the general price level. The Classical Dichotomy: Real vs Monetary Sides of the Economy The introduction of money into the model leads to what is known as the classical dichotomy – a strict separation between the determination of real variables and nominal variables. According to the classical dichotomy, real variables (such as real GDP, real consumption, employment, and relative prices of goods) are determined independently of nominal variables (such as the absolute price level, inflation rate, and nominal money supply)[5]. In practical terms, one can first solve for the real equilibrium of the economy (the allocation of resources and relative prices as if it were a barter economy), and then determine the nominal price level by considering the money market. The presence of money serves only to convert the barter terms of trade into monetary terms; it does not alter the underlying real equilibrium. This dichotomy reflects the notion that money is neutral in its effect on the real economy, an idea we explore more below. In the classical view, money’s sole function in general equilibrium is to determine the units in which prices are quoted – essentially acting as a unit of account and medium of exchange without changing real outcomes. Walras’s model extended to include money treats money as an additional “good” for which supply and demand must equilibrate, but crucially, changes in the supply of money do not affect the equilibrium quantities of other goods or relative prices (they only affect absolute nominal prices). The system of equations describing the economy can thus be partitioned into a real subsystem and a monetary subsystem, with minimal feedback from the monetary side to the real side – this is the essence of the classical dichotomy[5]. Historically, classical economists like David Hume illustrated the dichotomy with thought experiments: if overnight every person’s stock of money doubled, people would initially feel wealthier and try to spend more, but with no change in the real quantity of goods, prices would soon double as well. Ultimately, the economy would be in the same real state as before, just with all prices (and monetary values) scaled up. The real output, employment, and relative prices would be unchanged – only the monetary values differ. This parable encapsulates the classical dichotomy by showing that real wealth hasn’t changed even though nominal money holdings did. Neutrality of Money in the Classical Model From the classical dichotomy stems the principle of the neutrality of money. Money is said to be neutral if changes in the stock of money have no effect on real economic variables (like real output or the real interest rate), affecting only nominal variables (like the price level or nominal incomes). In the classical theory, with flexible prices and wages, money is neutral even in the short run. A change in the money supply – whether through gold discoveries in a classical gold standard economy or open-market operations by a central bank – will proportionally change all money prices but leave real production and consumption decisions unaltered[6]. Long-run monetary neutrality is a core implication: for example, a permanent doubling of the money supply is predicted to eventually lead to a doubling of the price level (a 100% inflation), with real GDP, employment, and real interest rates returning to their original levels[7]. In classical thought, this adjustment happens relatively quickly as prices are fully flexible. All agents understand that only nominal values have changed, so there is no lasting effect on output or other real magnitudes. How does this adjustment occur? We can think in terms of supply and demand for money. Suppose the economy’s real output \\(Y\\) and money demand behavior are initially given, and the central bank unexpectedly doubles the money supply (\\(M\\)). At the old price level \\(P_0\\), there is now excess supply of money – people have more money than they desire to hold relative to goods. They will try to get rid of the excess money balances by increasing spending on goods and services (or purchasing assets). This creates an excess demand for goods (equivalently, an excess demand for all non-money assets) by Walras’ Law[8]. With more money chasing the same amount of goods, prices begin to rise. Higher prices reduce the real purchasing power of the excess money, thereby reducing the excess money balances. The price level will continue to rise until the real value of the money supply \\(M/P\\) has increased enough that people are willing to hold the entire new money supply. At the new equilibrium, the price level \\(P_1\\) will be higher (in fact, roughly double \\(P_0\\) in this scenario), such that the ratio \\(M/P\\) is restored to the original real money demand. Real variables (the quantity of goods produced and consumed) remain the same, but all nominal prices have doubled. Essentially, the equilibrium shifts from \\((M_0, P_0)\\) to \\((M_1, P_1)\\), with \\(M_1 = 2 M_0\\) and \\(P_1 \\approx 2 P_0\\), so that the real money supply \\(M_1/P_1\\) equals the original \\(M_0/P_0\\). To visualize money neutrality, consider a simple money market diagram (value of money on the vertical axis and quantity of money on the horizontal axis). The demand for money is downward sloping in terms of the value of money (i.e. \\(1/P\\)) – at higher price levels (lower \\(1/P\\)), people need to hold more nominal money for transactions, so the demand for nominal balances increases as \\(1/P\\) falls. The supply of money is fixed exogenously by the central bank (a vertical line at the given \\(M\\)). Equilibrium occurs where money supply equals money demand, determining the equilibrium \\(1/P\\). Now, if the money supply increases (the vertical line shifts to the right), the intersection with the demand curve moves downward – the equilibrium value of money \\(1/P\\) falls, which means the price level \\(P\\) rises in proportion to the increase in \\(M\\). The following figure illustrates this outcome:\nIllustration: Equilibrium in the money market determines the value of money (the inverse of the price level). The demand for money (\\(D_M\\)) is downward sloping in terms of \\(1/P\\), and the money supply (\\(S_M\\)) is vertical (fixed by policy). An increase in the money supply from \\(M_0\\) to \\(M_1\\) shifts the supply curve rightward, causing the equilibrium value of money to drop from \\(1/P_0\\) to \\(1/P_1\\) – equivalently, the price level \\(P\\) rises. In classical theory, real output (\\(Y\\)) and money demand parameters are unchanged, so this change in \\(P\\) leaves real variables unaffected.[9] In the classical long-run perspective, empirical evidence does show that countries with persistently higher money growth tend to have higher inflation, consistent with money neutrality in the long term. Cross-country studies find a close one-to-one relationship between the rate of money growth (in excess of real GDP growth) and the inflation rate in the long run[10]. For example, during episodes of hyperinflation, excessive money creation clearly leads to soaring prices: Zimbabwe’s central bank, by printing money in the 2000s, contributed to one of the worst hyperinflations on record – at its peak in 2008, prices in Zimbabwe were estimated to be rising at an astronomical rate of 500 billion percent per year[11]. Such extreme cases demonstrate that pouring huge amounts of money into an economy with limited output will drastically reduce money’s value (raise the price level). In more moderate circumstances too, “if the money supply grows too big relative to the size of an economy, the unit value of the currency diminishes – its purchasing power falls and prices rise”[12], which is precisely the quantity theory prediction. It should be noted, however, that classical theory abstracts from short-run frictions. In reality, prices and wages may not adjust immediately (they can be sticky in the short run), so a sudden increase in the money supply might temporarily boost real activity – a possibility acknowledged even by later monetarist economists[13]. The classical model, though, assumes away these short-run rigidities, focusing on the ultimate outcome after prices have fully adjusted. In that full-adjustment scenario, money is neutral: aside from the price level and other nominal values, nothing real has changed. The Cambridge Equation of Exchange (Cash-Balance Approach) To determine the price level in a monetary economy, classical economists augmented the Walrasian real system with an equation describing money demand – famously formulated by the Cambridge school of economists (Alfred Marshall, A.C. Pigou, and even a young John Maynard Keynes) in the early 1900s. The Cambridge equation (or cash-balance equation) focuses on the demand for money as a proportion of income. It can be expressed as: M^d=k P Y, where \\(M^d\\) is the desired nominal money holdings (money demand), \\(P\\) is the general price level, \\(Y\\) is real national income (real output), and \\(k\\) is a parameter representing the fraction of nominal income that people wish to hold in the form of money (their cash holding ratio). In equilibrium, we assume the money market clears, so the supply of money \\(M\\) equals money demand \\(M^d\\). Thus, the Cambridge equilibrium condition is: M=k P Y. This simple equation embodies the idea that people plan to hold a certain proportion \\(k\\) of their income in cash balances for convenience and safety. The value of \\(k\\) reflects factors like payment habits, financial technology, and preferences for liquidity – for example, if people keep one month’s worth of income as cash on average, \\(k\\) might be about \\(1/12 \\approx 0.08\\). The velocity of money \\(V\\) is the inverse of this cash-balance ratio: V=1/k. Velocity \\(V\\) measures how many times per period the average unit of currency is spent on final goods and services (i.e. how quickly money circulates). If \\(k=0.1\\), then \\(V=10\\), meaning each dollar (or pound, etc.) is used to purchase 10 dollars’ worth of output per period on average. The Cambridge equation can be rewritten to make the price level the subject: P=M/(k Y). This tells us that for a given real output \\(Y\\) and given money demand parameter \\(k\\), the price level \\(P\\) adjusts in proportion to the money supply \\(M\\). In other words, the quantity of money in circulation relative to the economy’s output (adjusted by how much money people want to hold) determines the price level. If the money supply doubles, then unless there is a change in \\(Y\\) or \\(k\\), the price level must double to maintain the equality \\(M = k P Y\\). In the classical model, \\(Y\\) is determined by real factors (and in the long run by things like technology and resources), and \\(k\\) is assumed to be stable (or exogenously given by institutions and preferences). Therefore, any change in \\(M\\) translates to an proportional change in \\(P\\). This Cambridge equation thus fills the gap in the Walrasian system: whereas the Walrasian real equilibrium couldn’t pin down the absolute level of prices, adding the money market equilibrium condition (\\(M\\) supply equals \\(M^d = kPY\\) demand) yields a solution for the nominal price level[14]. The classical dichotomy is evident here – the real variable \\(Y\\) is solved elsewhere, and once \\(Y\\) is known, the nominal variable \\(P\\) adjusts to satisfy the money equation given \\(M\\). It’s worth noting that the Cambridge cash-balance approach is just a different perspective on the quantity theory of money, emphasizing money demand instead of supply. Unlike the “transactions” version of the quantity theory (associated with American economist Irving Fisher, discussed next), which treats velocity as given and focuses on the flow of money spending, the Cambridge equation arises from thinking about how much of their income people wish to hold in monetary form at any time. Both approaches, however, arrive at a similar conclusion: a linkage between the money supply and nominal income. Indeed, if we take the Cambridge equation and multiply both sides by \\(V = 1/k\\), we get \\(M \\cdot V = P \\cdot Y\\). Thus the Cambridge equation is mathematically equivalent to the more famous equation of exchange, as long as we identify \\(V = 1/k\\)[15]. The two formulations differ subtly in interpretation – the classical (Fisherian) view tends to treat \\(V\\) as a constant technical parameter and money as only a medium of exchange, whereas the Cambridge view gives \\(k\\) (hence \\(V\\)) a behavioral interpretation and recognizes money’s role as a store of value that people may desire to hold. But in the strict classical theory, \\(k\\) (and hence \\(V\\)) was taken to be fairly stable in the short run, so the distinction did not undermine the overall prediction. The Quantity Theory of Money (QTM) The Quantity Theory of Money is the centerpiece of classical monetary theory. It is often summarized by the equation of exchange: M×V=P×Y. Here \\(M\\) is the money supply, \\(V\\) is the velocity of money, \\(P\\) is the price level, and \\(Y\\) is real output (often \\(Y\\) is taken to be real GDP for the whole economy). This equation is an identity – it defines velocity \\(V\\) as the ratio of nominal GDP (\\(P \\times Y\\)) to the money stock \\(M\\). It says that the total amount of money multiplied by the number of times each unit of money is used to buy goods (velocity) equals the total monetary value of goods purchased (\\(P \\times Y\\)) in the economy. As an accounting statement, this always holds true by construction in any given period. The equation of exchange becomes a powerful theory (the QTM) with one key additional assumption: velocity \\(V\\) is constant (or at least predictable), and independent of other variables, and real output \\(Y\\) is determined by non-monetary factors (e.g. resources and technology, as in the Walrasian real system). Under these assumptions, any change in \\(M\\) must be reflected primarily in \\(P\\). In growth rate form, the quantity theory predicts that the inflation rate (growth of \\(P\\)) will equal the growth rate of money minus the growth rate of real output (since \\(V\\) is constant)[16]. For example, if the money supply grows 5% per year and real GDP grows 2% per year, QTM would predict roughly 3% annual inflation in the long run (5% – 2% = 3%). In short, the Quantity Theory of Money posits a direct, proportional relationship between the money supply and the price level, when other factors are held constant[17]. It is “one of the oldest hypotheses in economics,” linking excessive money growth to inflation[18][19]. A classical quantity theorist typically assumes that \\(V\\) is stable due to institutions or habits (for instance, people might get paid monthly and pay bills monthly, implying a regular turnover of money). Empirically, velocity does change over time, but in early 20th century economies it was often sufficiently stable in the short run that treating it as roughly constant was not a bad approximation[20]. Meanwhile, \\(Y\\) in the long run is determined by labor, capital, technology, etc., not by the money supply. Therefore, increases in \\(M\\) lead to proportionate increases in \\(P\\). This formalizes the intuition behind money neutrality. As an IMF explainer succinctly put it, “if the money supply grows too big relative to the size of an economy, the unit value of the currency diminishes – its purchasing power falls and prices rise”[12]. The Quantity Theory thus provides a mechanism for how inflation can be controlled by controlling money growth. It underlies the famous maxim by Milton Friedman (a leading 20th-century monetarist) that “inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.” Historical example: The QTM was vividly demonstrated during the Great Inflation of the 1970s. In the United States and United Kingdom, rapid growth of the money supply was accompanied by surging prices. Monetarist economists, reviving the classical QTM, argued that to bring down inflation, central banks needed to restrain money growth. Indeed, in 1979 the U.S. Federal Reserve under Paul Volcker dramatically changed policy to target the money supply growth rate. By limiting money growth, the Fed was able to squeeze inflation out of the system by the early 1980s, albeit at the cost of a recession[21]. Similarly, the U.K. adopted monetarist policies under Margaret Thatcher. These policy episodes were inspired directly by QTM logic – essentially applying classical theory to practice – and they lend support to the long-run link between money and prices. Many countries thereafter maintained a focus on low money growth to keep inflation low (until the practice of inflation targeting eventually replaced direct money targets, as discussed later). Another dramatic example is the relationship between money growth and hyperinflation. We mentioned Zimbabwe’s hyperinflation; similarly, classic case studies like the Weimar German hyperinflation of 1923 show a clear QTM pattern. In Weimar Germany, the government massively increased the paper money supply to finance expenses, and the price level exploded in proportion, to the point where money became nearly worthless. Such episodes reinforce that, when taken to extremes, money growth and inflation go hand-in-hand. It’s important to realize that the Quantity Theory of Money (QTM), as used in classical theory, is more than just the identity \\(MV=PY\\). It is the hypothesis that causality runs from left to right: the money supply is exogenous (determined by the central bank or gold supply) and is the primary driver of nominal GDP and the price level in the long run, with velocity and real GDP growth taken as given. The QTM assumes long-run neutrality (money only affects \\(P\\)) and often also assumes dichotomy (that real output \\(Y\\) is determined independently). Under these conditions, controlling inflation is as simple as controlling money supply growth. Monetarist economists in the 20th century extended this classical theory, asserting that a stable money growth rule would lead to stable prices[22][23]. They pointed to statistical correlations between money and prices, and argued, for example, that the Great Depression of the 1930s in the U.S. was largely due to a sharp contraction of the money stock (a thesis advanced by Friedman and Schwartz in A Monetary History of the United States[24]). The QTM has seen a resurgence in debate in recent years. After the Global Financial Crisis of 2007–09, central banks injected unprecedented amounts of money into economies (through quantitative easing), yet inflation in many advanced economies remained subdued for a long time in the 2010s. This led some to question whether the classical quantity relation had broken down, as velocity appeared to decline. However, following the COVID-19 pandemic, money growth spiked again (for example, U.S. M2 money supply grew over 25% year-on-year at one point in 2020), and by 2021–2022 inflation jumped to multi-decade highs. Analysts noted that a simple quantity-theoretic linkage between money and inflation seemed to reassert itself during this period[25]. In fact, a basic model using money growth did successfully signal the rise of inflation post-2020, even though it had failed to predict inflation in the prior two decades of low inflation[26][16]. This mixed record underscores that the QTM holds well under some circumstances (especially when there are large swings in money growth and when the economy is near full capacity), but can be less reliable in others – a point we now examine as we discuss the limitations of the classical view. Limitations of the Classical View While the classical theory of money provides a useful benchmark and is largely borne out in the long run, economists have long identified several limitations and caveats to its applicability. In practice, the strict classical dichotomy and money neutrality do not always hold, especially in the short run or under certain conditions. Here are some key limitations and challenges to the classical view: Short-Run Non-Neutrality and Price Stickiness: The classical model assumes fully flexible prices and wages that instantaneously clear markets. In reality, many prices (e.g. wages in contracts, or prices set by firms) adjust slowly. In the presence of such sticky prices, changes in the money supply can have short-term real effects. This was a central insight of John Maynard Keynes and later Keynesian economics: if the money supply increases, in the short run it may lower interest rates and stimulate investment and consumption, thus increasing real output and employment – contrary to neutrality. Only over time, as prices gradually adjust, will the full effect be reflected in the price level. Keynesians argue that during recessions or periods of slack, output is demand-determined, and an increase in money (and thus demand) can raise output rather than prices. The classical dichotomy is thus violated in the short run: real and nominal variables are intertwined. Modern empirical research confirms that money is not neutral in the short term – for instance, expansionary monetary policy often boosts real GDP for a couple of years before inflation catches up. Even monetarist economists accept the idea of short-run monetary nonneutrality due to lags in price adjustment[13]. The long-run neutrality may still hold, but the journey matters for economic fluctuations. Unstable Velocity and Money Demand: The classical QTM assumes velocity (\\(V\\)) or the Cambridge \\(k\\) is fixed (or at least exogenous and stable). In reality, velocity can and does change due to various factors – interest rates, financial innovation, payment technologies, and economic uncertainty can all affect how much money people want to hold relative to income. Keynes, in his critique of the classical theory, introduced the idea of speculative demand for money (part of his liquidity preference theory), suggesting that \\(k\\) is not a constant but depends on the interest rate: when interest rates are low, people are less incentivized to hold bonds and more content holding money, so money demand rises (velocity falls), and vice versa. He also noted that expectations of deflation or financial turmoil can make people hoard cash (increasing \\(k\\) dramatically). In symbolic form, Keynesians might express money demand as \\(M^d = k(i) \\, P \\, Y\\), where \\(k\\) is a function of the nominal interest rate \\(i\\) (and perhaps other variables like expectations of inflation)[27]. This view implies that velocity is endogenous and can vary widely – which undermines the simple classical QTM prediction. Indeed, Keynesians attach little or no significance to a rigid quantity theory rule precisely because velocity is inherently unstable[28]. Empirical history vindicates this concern: for example, in the 1980s, financial deregulation and innovation in banking altered the stability of money demand in the US and UK, causing velocity of traditional aggregates (like \\(M1\\) or \\(M2\\)) to shift unpredictably. During the 1990s and 2000s, the rise of credit cards, money market funds, and later digital payment platforms continued to change money holding patterns. Central banks found that targeting a money supply growth rate (as suggested by monetarism) became unreliable because the relationship between money, output, and prices was weakening – the money demand function was shifting. This is one reason why central banks moved away from strict money supply targets to interest rate targets and inflation targeting frameworks by the 1990s: the link between measured money supply and inflation became harder to discern in real time[29][30]. Empirical Variability in the Money-Inflation Relationship: The long-run correlation between money growth and inflation is strong across broad samples and extreme cases, but over shorter horizons and moderate inflation environments the relationship can be obscured by other factors. Studies have found that when inflation is low and stable, money growth often does not closely predict inflation – velocity may fluctuate or other forces (like supply/demand shocks) dominate short-run inflation dynamics[31]. For instance, in the two decades before the 2020s, many advanced economies saw relatively high growth in central bank money (due to quantitative easing) but inflation remained low, as much of the new money was effectively stored in banks as excess reserves or was offset by declines in money velocity. A Dallas Fed analysis noted that a simple money-growth-based model would have badly under-predicted or over-predicted inflation in those years, reflecting an unstable relationship between money and inflation in environments where inflation expectations are anchored[32]. This does not invalidate the QTM in the long run, but it shows that the short-to-medium run link can loosen. When the regime changes – as in 2021 when inflation re-emerged – the link appeared to strengthen again, reminding us that context matters[17][33]. The BIS (Bank for International Settlements) recently reported that money growth tends to be a more reliable indicator of inflation during high-inflation regimes than in low-inflation regimes[31]. In summary, the QTM’s assumption of a stable velocity is more of a conditional truth; velocity can be volatile, and policy must take that into account. Definition of Money and Financial Innovation: Classical theory assumes a clear definition of “money” – often implicitly referring to currency or a narrow aggregate. In practice, money comes in different forms (cash, checking deposits, savings accounts, money market funds, etc.), and the boundary between money and other financial assets can shift. If people move funds between money and near-money assets, the effective money supply for transactions might change even if base money doesn’t, affecting velocity calculations. Over the years, definitions like \\(M1\\), \\(M2\\), \\(M3\\) were created, and their velocities behaved differently. The classical story is simplified and doesn’t fully capture these complexities of a modern credit-based monetary system where commercial banks create money (via lending) and central bank control is mostly indirect. It turned out to be challenging to find a monetary aggregate that has both a stable velocity and strong link to inflation in real time. This is another reason why central banks in practice target interest rates rather than the money supply nowadays – they can more directly influence economic conditions through rates, whereas controlling money growth alone proved insufficient when velocity shifted. The classical theory’s implications remain true in the long run (too much broad money growth will eventually cause inflation), but short-run monetary policy must deal with uncertainty in money demand. Economic Conditions (Liquidity Traps and Confidence): In some extreme situations, changes in the money supply may have little effect on either prices or output – a situation known as a liquidity trap. This occurs, for example, when interest rates are near zero and investors have essentially infinite demand for liquidity (money) at that rate. In a liquidity trap (as during the Great Depression or Japan in the 1990s or globally in the late 2000s), increasing the money supply might simply lead to people holding more cash (an increase in \\(k\\)) with no increase in spending – thus neither output nor prices rise much. This scenario is outside the classical theory, which assumes away such pathological cases. It required Keynesian analysis to explain: when confidence is shattered and interest rates are at the lower bound, the classical dichotomy breaks down completely – money is non-neutral even in potentially long periods because prices may even fall (deflation) despite monetary expansion. Fortunately, such traps are rare, but the possibility highlights that the neutrality of money is not a universal law but a conditional outcome. Integration with Real Finance and Interest Rates: The classical theory in its pure form abstracts from how money interacts with interest rates and asset markets. In reality, a change in the money supply can affect interest rates (at least in the short run before prices adjust), which in turn can affect investment and consumption. The classical model assumed the loanable funds market adjusts interest rates based on saving and investment, independent of the money supply. However, if the central bank injects money, it may temporarily lower interest rates (if we hold prices fixed in the very short run), causing real effects – this is essentially the Keynesian transmission mechanism. Modern New Classical and New Keynesian models have incorporated money or monetary policy into a broader framework with interest rate rules and expectations, something the simplistic classical model does not do. Contemporary challenges – Digital Currencies: A very modern consideration is how digital currencies and fintech innovations affect the classical theory. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, or central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), represent new forms of money (or quasi-money). Do they change the quantity theory? So far, there is no evidence that they overturn basic monetary principles – the classical logic would still apply to an economy’s overall money supply broadly defined. For instance, one empirical study found “no change in velocity or the money multiplier after the rise of cryptocurrencies”, suggesting that the advent of crypto has not materially altered aggregate money demand or the effectiveness of monetary policy[34]. However, digital innovations can affect \\(k\\) in the Cambridge equation by making transactions easier (potentially raising velocity) or introducing alternative assets that serve some functions of money. Central banks are closely watching these developments. The consensus is that while the forms of money are evolving, the fundamental constraint – that if too much liquidity chases too few goods, the value of money will drop – remains as true as ever. Digital currencies might change how we measure and control the money supply, but they do not negate the classical long-run link between money and prices. In light of these limitations, modern macroeconomists view the classical theory of money as a long-run benchmark rather than a complete description for all time horizons. It offers a valid intuition for why sustained money growth leads to inflation (and conversely, why controlling money growth can stabilize prices). However, for short-run analysis and policy design, we use more elaborate frameworks that account for price stickiness, expectations, and financial frictions (for example, the IS-LM model in Keynesian tradition or New Keynesian dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models). These frameworks relax the classical dichotomy – allowing monetary policy to have real effects in the short run – while typically still embedding long-run neutrality of money as a special case. Central banks today generally target inflation directly (often through interest-rate policy) rather than the money supply, implicitly acknowledging that velocity is unstable in the short run. Yet, the spirit of the quantity theory survives: central bankers recognize that excessive money creation will ultimately be inflationary[35], and keeping inflation low and stable in the long run requires not letting money grow far out of line with the economy’s capacity to produce goods and services. Summary Walrasian Foundations: The classical theory is built on a Walrasian general equilibrium of the real economy, where flexible prices ensure all markets clear. In a barter setting, only relative prices are determined; a purely real model cannot pin down the absolute price level[2]. Money as a Veil: Introducing money separates real and nominal variables. The classical dichotomy holds that real economic outcomes (output, relative prices, real interest rates) are determined by real factors, independent of the money supply[5]. Money provides a unit of account and medium of exchange but is a “veil” over the real economy – changing the money supply only changes nominal prices, not the real allocation of resources[1]. Neutrality of Money: In the classical view, money is neutral in both the long run and (in the absence of frictions) the short run. A change in the money supply leads to an equal proportional change in the price level and other nominal values, leaving real GDP, employment, and real interest rates unaffected[6]. This implies that inflation is fundamentally a monetary phenomenon in the long term. Historical episodes of high inflation underscore this one-to-one link between money growth and prices[36][11]. Cambridge Equation and QTM: The classical theory determines the price level via the Cambridge cash-balance equation \\(M = kPY\\), which is equivalent to the quantity equation \\(MV = PY\\) with \\(V = 1/k\\). This formalizes the Quantity Theory of Money (QTM) – assuming stable velocity (or cash-holding ratio \\(k\\)) and exogenous output, the money supply governs the nominal GDP and price level[15][17]. Excess money supply, given output, bids up prices until money market equilibrium is restored. Contemporary Relevance: The classical theory provides a crucial baseline for thinking about inflation and monetary policy. It correctly predicts that countries with persistently rapid money growth (relative to output) experience high inflation[37]. Monetarist policies in the 1970s–80s were inspired by this theory and had success in curbing inflation by restraining money growth[21]. Even today, surges in the money supply (e.g. during the COVID-19 crisis) are closely watched for inflationary impact[25]. Limitations: In practice, the strict classical dichotomy breaks down in the short run. Because of sticky prices, variable velocity, and financial complexities, money is not always neutral in the short-to-medium term. Velocity can shift due to changes in interest rates or public confidence, weakening the link between money and prices[28][32]. Accordingly, modern central banks target inflation via interest rates and other tools rather than fixing the money supply growth alone. The classical theory is best viewed as a long-run anchor – in the long run, excessive money creation will cause inflation – but with the understanding that short-run dynamics can deviate from the classical predictions.

    "text": "Money is a core institution of modern economies. A practical working definition is that money is any asset that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services in a given economic community. The defining feature here is general acceptability: an agent accepts money in exchange not because they wish to consume it, but because they expect others to accept it in subsequent transactions.\nMoney matters because it makes decentralised exchange feasible at scale. In a pure barter economy, trade requires a double coincidence of wants: each party must have what the other desires (Jevons, 1875/1876). This requirement is restrictive and generates significant transaction costs. Money relaxes this constraint by allowing exchange to occur in (at least) two steps: sell what you have for money, then use money to purchase what you want.\nHistorically, many objects have served monetary roles: commodity monies (e.g., gold and silver), representative monies (claims redeemable into a commodity), and, today, fiat money issued by the state and/or central bank. Modern fiat money is not redeemable for a commodity and is intrinsically worthless in consumption terms; its value is sustained by institutional frameworks, legal and tax structures, and credibility. In the contemporary economy, money exists in multiple forms: physical currency, bank deposits transferable through payment systems, and central-bank reserves used for interbank settlement.\nThis chapter is organised around the canonical functions of money:\n\nUnit of account (the economy’s common measure of value),\nMedium of exchange (the means of payment in transactions),\nStore of value (an asset held over time).\n\nWe then analyse liquidity—the property that links money to broader asset markets—and conclude with the contrast between Classical and Keynesian perspectives on money’s macroeconomic importance (Keynes, 1936).\n\n\n\n\nA unit of account is a common measure in which prices and values are expressed. This role is conceptually distinct from the medium-of-exchange role: a society could in principle use an abstract unit of account for pricing and contracting while settling transactions with other assets. In practice, however, the monetary unit (pounds, euros, dollars) typically serves as the unit of account.\n\n\nThe most fundamental object in valuation is the relative price (or exchange ratio): how many units of one good exchange for one unit of another.\nWithout a unit of account, describing values requires listing pairwise exchange ratios for all goods. The number of required exchange ratios grows quickly with the number of goods. With n goods, a complete barter price system requires \\(\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\\) exchange ratios. For large n, this is approximately \\(n^2/2\\), which becomes unmanageable as product variety increases.\nA unit of account dramatically reduces informational complexity. If each good has a money price, only n prices need to be quoted, and any relative price can be computed as a ratio of two money prices. This is the economy of measurement created by money as unit of account.\n\n\n\nThe unit-of-account function is most useful when the unit is relatively stable in purchasing power. If the unit itself changes value unpredictably, it is like trying to measure length with a ruler that keeps changing size. Inflation makes price comparisons harder, disrupts long-term contracting, and increases the resources devoted to repricing and indexation.\nIn high-inflation or hyperinflation episodes, domestic money often fails as a unit of account and people may shift to a foreign currency (partial “dollarisation”) or to indexed units. For example, Venezuela experienced extremely high inflation in the late 2010s, and pricing and saving behaviour increasingly moved toward stable foreign currencies (IMF DataMapper, n.d.). The general economic point is that price stability supports the unit-of-account role; instability undermines it.\n\n\n\nPost‑2010 innovations highlight that being technologically novel is not sufficient to become a unit of account. Many cryptocurrencies are highly volatile, which makes them unattractive as pricing units for everyday goods and services. Even where legal experiments occurred—such as El Salvador’s 2021 Bitcoin legal tender policy—prices and contracts largely remained denominated in dollars, not Bitcoin, consistent with the idea that a unit of account requires stability and broad trust. IMF programme documentation reports that legal changes in 2025 removed key legal-tender features (including the obligation to accept Bitcoin), reflecting limited adoption and significant policy concerns (IMF, 2025).\nBy contrast, stablecoins seek to inherit stability by pegging to a fiat unit (usually the U.S. dollar). Their “moneyness” therefore depends on the credibility of the peg and on the legal/financial structures backing the promise of convertibility.\n\n\n\n\n\nA medium of exchange is an asset that agents accept in exchange for goods and services with the intention of using it to purchase other goods and services in the future. This function is the most visible and is closely tied to money’s central economic contribution: reducing transaction costs.\n\n\nBarter trade is a one-step exchange of one good for another. A monetary transaction typically involves two steps (sell for money, then buy with money), which may appear more complex at first glance. The key point is that barter requires a double coincidence of wants. In a decentralised economy with many goods and heterogeneous preferences, satisfying this condition is rare and costly.\nJevons (1875/1876) emphasised that the main friction is not conceptual but practical: it is costly to search for a counterparty who both has what you want and wants what you have. Monetary exchange solves this problem by allowing trade with any counterparty who accepts money, which—by definition—is “everyone.”\n\n\n\nA useful way to see the role of a medium of exchange is to imagine that, without money, an economy would require a dense network of “trading posts” or market arrangements for each pair of goods. With n goods, \\(\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\\) bilateral trading posts would be needed for direct barter across all pairs, which scales poorly. With money as a medium of exchange, each good needs only a market against money, and any two goods can be traded indirectly through money. This is the economy of exchange that money provides.\n\n\n\nModern monetary economics formalised these intuitions in search-theoretic models. In seminal work, Kiyotaki and Wright (1989) show that under trading frictions, certain assets can become accepted as media of exchange because they lower transaction costs and increase the probability of successful trade. Later work (Kiyotaki & Wright, 1993) provides a broader framework for monetary exchange as a solution to decentralised trading problems.\nThese models help clarify why acceptability is both cause and consequence of being money: an asset is accepted because others accept it, creating a network effect. But acceptance is not arbitrary; assets with suitable properties (portability, durability, divisibility, and low verification cost) are more likely to emerge as media of exchange.\n\n\n\nIn modern economies, many transactions are executed electronically. Cards, mobile wallets, and real-time transfer systems are payment technologies layered on top of money. Under the hood, settlement typically occurs in central bank money (reserves and cash) and bank deposit money denominated in the national unit of account.\nCryptocurrencies have been proposed as alternative payment instruments. Empirical work suggests that, in many jurisdictions, their use as everyday payment media has been limited (Umlauft, 2018). Where adoption has been attempted at national scale, the outcomes underline the importance of stability, infrastructure, regulation, and trust.\n\n\n\n\n\nMoney also functions as a store of value: it transfers purchasing power through time. This function follows naturally from the medium-of-exchange role because sales and purchases are often separated by time; in that gap, money is held as an asset.\nHowever, money is not the only store of value. Bonds, equities, property, and other assets store value and often deliver higher returns. Money’s comparative advantage is liquidity—the capacity to be used immediately as a means of payment.\n\n\nBecause money typically yields little or no interest, holding money involves an opportunity cost: the foregone return from holding an interest-bearing asset instead. This opportunity cost is a key determinant of money demand.\nKeynes (1936) emphasised that agents demand money not only for transactions but also for liquidity as a store of value under uncertainty. In this framework, the interest rate can be interpreted as a premium required to induce agents to hold less liquid assets instead of money.\n\n\n\nInflation erodes the real value of nominal money balances. Over long horizons, cash is typically a poor store of value unless nominal interest on liquid balances compensates for inflation. When inflation is high and unpredictable, agents shift into alternative stores of value (foreign currency, real assets, indexed claims), weakening money’s store-of-value role and potentially destabilising the monetary system.\nRecent macroeconomic experience renewed attention to these issues. Following the COVID‑19 shock, several advanced economies experienced the highest inflation rates in decades. A large empirical literature examines the roles of supply constraints, fiscal expansion, and monetary conditions; as part of this debate, BIS research has argued that money growth helps explain cross-country variation in the inflation surge, especially when inflation moves into higher regimes (Borio, Hofmann, & Zakrajšek, 2023; Borio, Hofmann, & Zakrajšek, 2024).\n\n\n\n\n\nLiquidity is a central concept linking money to asset markets and financial stability. A practical definition is:\n\nLiquidity is the ease with which an asset can be exchanged for goods and services (or converted into a generally accepted means of payment) quickly, predictably, and with little loss of value.\n\nMoney is the most liquid asset. Other assets are “money-like” to the extent that they can be converted into money rapidly at low cost and low risk.\n\n\nLiquidity is commonly associated with:\n\nMarketability (active markets and many potential buyers),\nPredictability of exchange value (low short-run price volatility),\nReversibility (small bid–ask spreads and low transaction costs),\nDivisibility (capacity to trade in small denominations).\n\nThese criteria help explain why agents are often willing to hold money despite its low return: they obtain liquidity services in exchange for foregoing interest.\n\n\n\nBecause liquidity is a spectrum, monetary authorities define multiple monetary aggregates. Narrow measures (e.g., currency and demand deposits) are most liquid. Broader measures include less liquid but still money-like instruments (e.g., some savings deposits).\nIn the U.S., widely used series include M2, available through the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis FRED database (Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, n.d.). While definitions differ across countries, the central idea is consistent: as aggregates broaden, liquidity declines and return often increases.\n\n\n\nLiquidity conditions can change abruptly in crises. Even normally liquid markets can become illiquid when risk aversion spikes and balance sheets are constrained, producing a “flight to liquidity.” This is one reason central banks maintain lender-of-last-resort frameworks and market backstops to prevent liquidity shocks from turning into solvency crises and macroeconomic contractions.\n\n\n\nCBDCs are frequently analysed as potential new forms of sovereign money, designed to be safe and highly liquid. The Atlantic Council’s CBDC Tracker reports that a large share of countries are exploring, piloting, or developing CBDCs (Atlantic Council, n.d.). If introduced at scale, CBDCs could reshape retail payments, alter the composition of liquid assets held by households, and raise new questions for banking-sector funding and financial stability.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe macroeconomic importance of money is often introduced through a contrast between Classical and Keynesian approaches.\n\n\nIn classical monetary thought, money is essential for transactions but largely neutral in the long run: changes in the money supply affect nominal variables (such as prices) but not real variables (such as output and employment), once prices fully adjust. This idea underpins the classical dichotomy and long-run neutrality propositions often associated with quantity-theoretic reasoning.\n\n\n\nKeynes argued that money is not only a medium of exchange and unit of account; it is also a store of value held for liquidity under uncertainty (Keynes, 1936). Because agents can choose to hoard money, shifts in liquidity preference can spill over into asset markets and goods markets, affecting interest rates, investment, and aggregate demand. Under price and wage rigidities, these monetary and financial conditions can affect real output and employment in the short and medium run.\n\n\n\nContemporary macroeconomics typically combines elements of both traditions: money is often viewed as approximately neutral in the long run, but monetary policy and liquidity conditions are central to short-run fluctuations. Modern frameworks often focus on interest rates and financial conditions rather than money aggregates alone (e.g., Woodford, 2003), but the post‑pandemic inflation episode revived interest in money growth and liquidity alongside standard policy-rate channels (Borio et al., 2023; 2024).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy does the number of required barter exchange ratios grow so rapidly as the number of goods increases? What informational problem does money solve?\nIn what sense is a stable unit of account a public good? How does inflation undermine it?\nUsing the idea of opportunity cost, explain why higher nominal interest rates typically reduce desired money holdings.\nWhy might a technologically superior payment instrument fail as “money” if it lacks broad acceptability?\nHow could CBDCs change the composition of liquid assets held by households and the banking sector?",

    "text": "Money is a core institution of modern economies. A practical working definition is that money is any asset that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services in a given economic community. The defining feature here is general acceptability: an agent accepts money in exchange not because they wish to consume it, but because they expect others to accept it in subsequent transactions.\nMoney matters because it makes decentralised exchange feasible at scale. In a pure barter economy, trade requires a double coincidence of wants: each party must have what the other desires (Jevons, 1875/1876). This requirement is restrictive and generates significant transaction costs. Money relaxes this constraint by allowing exchange to occur in (at least) two steps: sell what you have for money, then use money to purchase what you want.\nHistorically, many objects have served monetary roles: commodity monies (e.g., gold and silver), representative monies (claims redeemable into a commodity), and, today, fiat money issued by the state and/or central bank. Modern fiat money is not redeemable for a commodity and is intrinsically worthless in consumption terms; its value is sustained by institutional frameworks, legal and tax structures, and credibility. In the contemporary economy, money exists in multiple forms: physical currency, bank deposits transferable through payment systems, and central-bank reserves used for interbank settlement.\nThis chapter is organised around the canonical functions of money:\n\nUnit of account (the economy’s common measure of value),\nMedium of exchange (the means of payment in transactions),\nStore of value (an asset held over time).\n\nWe then analyse liquidity—the property that links money to broader asset markets—and conclude with the contrast between Classical and Keynesian perspectives on money’s macroeconomic importance (Keynes, 1936).",

    "text": "A unit of account is a common measure in which prices and values are expressed. This role is conceptually distinct from the medium-of-exchange role: a society could in principle use an abstract unit of account for pricing and contracting while settling transactions with other assets. In practice, however, the monetary unit (pounds, euros, dollars) typically serves as the unit of account.\n\n\nThe most fundamental object in valuation is the relative price (or exchange ratio): how many units of one good exchange for one unit of another.\nWithout a unit of account, describing values requires listing pairwise exchange ratios for all goods. The number of required exchange ratios grows quickly with the number of goods. With n goods, a complete barter price system requires \\(\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\\) exchange ratios. For large n, this is approximately \\(n^2/2\\), which becomes unmanageable as product variety increases.\nA unit of account dramatically reduces informational complexity. If each good has a money price, only n prices need to be quoted, and any relative price can be computed as a ratio of two money prices. This is the economy of measurement created by money as unit of account.\n\n\n\nThe unit-of-account function is most useful when the unit is relatively stable in purchasing power. If the unit itself changes value unpredictably, it is like trying to measure length with a ruler that keeps changing size. Inflation makes price comparisons harder, disrupts long-term contracting, and increases the resources devoted to repricing and indexation.\nIn high-inflation or hyperinflation episodes, domestic money often fails as a unit of account and people may shift to a foreign currency (partial “dollarisation”) or to indexed units. For example, Venezuela experienced extremely high inflation in the late 2010s, and pricing and saving behaviour increasingly moved toward stable foreign currencies (IMF DataMapper, n.d.). The general economic point is that price stability supports the unit-of-account role; instability undermines it.\n\n\n\nPost‑2010 innovations highlight that being technologically novel is not sufficient to become a unit of account. Many cryptocurrencies are highly volatile, which makes them unattractive as pricing units for everyday goods and services. Even where legal experiments occurred—such as El Salvador’s 2021 Bitcoin legal tender policy—prices and contracts largely remained denominated in dollars, not Bitcoin, consistent with the idea that a unit of account requires stability and broad trust. IMF programme documentation reports that legal changes in 2025 removed key legal-tender features (including the obligation to accept Bitcoin), reflecting limited adoption and significant policy concerns (IMF, 2025).\nBy contrast, stablecoins seek to inherit stability by pegging to a fiat unit (usually the U.S. dollar). Their “moneyness” therefore depends on the credibility of the peg and on the legal/financial structures backing the promise of convertibility.",

    "text": "A medium of exchange is an asset that agents accept in exchange for goods and services with the intention of using it to purchase other goods and services in the future. This function is the most visible and is closely tied to money’s central economic contribution: reducing transaction costs.\n\n\nBarter trade is a one-step exchange of one good for another. A monetary transaction typically involves two steps (sell for money, then buy with money), which may appear more complex at first glance. The key point is that barter requires a double coincidence of wants. In a decentralised economy with many goods and heterogeneous preferences, satisfying this condition is rare and costly.\nJevons (1875/1876) emphasised that the main friction is not conceptual but practical: it is costly to search for a counterparty who both has what you want and wants what you have. Monetary exchange solves this problem by allowing trade with any counterparty who accepts money, which—by definition—is “everyone.”\n\n\n\nA useful way to see the role of a medium of exchange is to imagine that, without money, an economy would require a dense network of “trading posts” or market arrangements for each pair of goods. With n goods, \\(\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\\) bilateral trading posts would be needed for direct barter across all pairs, which scales poorly. With money as a medium of exchange, each good needs only a market against money, and any two goods can be traded indirectly through money. This is the economy of exchange that money provides.\n\n\n\nModern monetary economics formalised these intuitions in search-theoretic models. In seminal work, Kiyotaki and Wright (1989) show that under trading frictions, certain assets can become accepted as media of exchange because they lower transaction costs and increase the probability of successful trade. Later work (Kiyotaki & Wright, 1993) provides a broader framework for monetary exchange as a solution to decentralised trading problems.\nThese models help clarify why acceptability is both cause and consequence of being money: an asset is accepted because others accept it, creating a network effect. But acceptance is not arbitrary; assets with suitable properties (portability, durability, divisibility, and low verification cost) are more likely to emerge as media of exchange.\n\n\n\nIn modern economies, many transactions are executed electronically. Cards, mobile wallets, and real-time transfer systems are payment technologies layered on top of money. Under the hood, settlement typically occurs in central bank money (reserves and cash) and bank deposit money denominated in the national unit of account.\nCryptocurrencies have been proposed as alternative payment instruments. Empirical work suggests that, in many jurisdictions, their use as everyday payment media has been limited (Umlauft, 2018). Where adoption has been attempted at national scale, the outcomes underline the importance of stability, infrastructure, regulation, and trust.",

    "text": "Money also functions as a store of value: it transfers purchasing power through time. This function follows naturally from the medium-of-exchange role because sales and purchases are often separated by time; in that gap, money is held as an asset.\nHowever, money is not the only store of value. Bonds, equities, property, and other assets store value and often deliver higher returns. Money’s comparative advantage is liquidity—the capacity to be used immediately as a means of payment.\n\n\nBecause money typically yields little or no interest, holding money involves an opportunity cost: the foregone return from holding an interest-bearing asset instead. This opportunity cost is a key determinant of money demand.\nKeynes (1936) emphasised that agents demand money not only for transactions but also for liquidity as a store of value under uncertainty. In this framework, the interest rate can be interpreted as a premium required to induce agents to hold less liquid assets instead of money.\n\n\n\nInflation erodes the real value of nominal money balances. Over long horizons, cash is typically a poor store of value unless nominal interest on liquid balances compensates for inflation. When inflation is high and unpredictable, agents shift into alternative stores of value (foreign currency, real assets, indexed claims), weakening money’s store-of-value role and potentially destabilising the monetary system.\nRecent macroeconomic experience renewed attention to these issues. Following the COVID‑19 shock, several advanced economies experienced the highest inflation rates in decades. A large empirical literature examines the roles of supply constraints, fiscal expansion, and monetary conditions; as part of this debate, BIS research has argued that money growth helps explain cross-country variation in the inflation surge, especially when inflation moves into higher regimes (Borio, Hofmann, & Zakrajšek, 2023; Borio, Hofmann, & Zakrajšek, 2024).",

    "title": "Classical Theory of Money",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The classical theory of money is an approach in macroeconomics asserting that money primarily influences nominal variables (prices, wages) and has negligible effect on real economic activity (output, employment) in the long run. Classical economists often say “money is a veil”, meaning that the system of money prices may obscure real economic relationships, but in reality the underlying real economy is unchanged by the quantity of money in circulation[1]. This theory, rooted in the 19th-century Walrasian general equilibrium framework and the early 20th-century Quantity Theory of Money, underpins the view that sustained changes in the money supply lead to proportional changes in the price level, with real variables determined by real factors like technology and preferences. In this reading, we outline the classical model of a monetary economy and its key implications – the Walrasian system of general equilibrium, the classical dichotomy between real and monetary sectors, the neutrality of money, the Cambridge equation of exchange, and the Quantity Theory of Money (QTM) – and discuss how these ideas hold up with contemporary examples. We also examine the limitations of the classical view, including situations (such as short-run economic fluctuations or extreme policy environments) where money may not be neutral and why modern economists and central banks have nuanced this theory.\n\n\n\nClassical theory builds on the Walrasian general equilibrium model of a barter economy (named after Léon Walras, 1834–1910, a pioneer of mathematical economics). In a Walrasian system, all markets for goods and services simultaneously clear through price adjustment. Formally, it consists of a set of market-clearing conditions (one for each good or factor) and a corresponding set of relative prices that adjust to equate supply and demand in every market[2]. Importantly, only relative prices matter in this system – prices are expressed in terms of one another (for instance, how many units of good A trade for one unit of good B). One good can be chosen as a numéraire (unit of account) to price all other goods, fixing the scale for relative prices.\nBecause all prices in Walrasian equilibrium are determined only up to a common scale, the model exhibits homogeneity: if all prices were doubled (or halved), the real allocations of goods would remain the same. This implies that in a purely real economy without money, the absolute price level is indeterminate – there is no unique solution for “the” price level, only for relative prices. In other words, the Walrasian model determines what and how much gets produced and consumed (real output and relative price ratios), but not the overall monetary value of those goods. Walras’ Law holds that if all but one markets are in equilibrium, the last market must also clear (excess supply in one market must be matched by excess demand in at least one other), ensuring consistency of the general equilibrium[3][4].\nIn this frictionless, barter-style economy, real variables – such as real output, the allocation of goods, and relative prices – are determined entirely by real factors (preferences, endowments, technology) without any reference to the money supply. This is the foundation of the classical idea that money is nonessential in determining real economic outcomes. However, to analyze an economy with money (a monetary economy), we need to introduce money into the Walrasian system in a way that pins down the general price level.\n\n\n\nThe introduction of money into the model leads to what is known as the classical dichotomy – a strict separation between the determination of real variables and nominal variables. According to the classical dichotomy, real variables (such as real GDP, real consumption, employment, and relative prices of goods) are determined independently of nominal variables (such as the absolute price level, inflation rate, and nominal money supply)[5]. In practical terms, one can first solve for the real equilibrium of the economy (the allocation of resources and relative prices as if it were a barter economy), and then determine the nominal price level by considering the money market. The presence of money serves only to convert the barter terms of trade into monetary terms; it does not alter the underlying real equilibrium.\nThis dichotomy reflects the notion that money is neutral in its effect on the real economy, an idea we explore more below. In the classical view, money’s sole function in general equilibrium is to determine the units in which prices are quoted – essentially acting as a unit of account and medium of exchange without changing real outcomes. Walras’s model extended to include money treats money as an additional “good” for which supply and demand must equilibrate, but crucially, changes in the supply of money do not affect the equilibrium quantities of other goods or relative prices (they only affect absolute nominal prices). The system of equations describing the economy can thus be partitioned into a real subsystem and a monetary subsystem, with minimal feedback from the monetary side to the real side – this is the essence of the classical dichotomy[5].\nHistorically, classical economists like David Hume illustrated the dichotomy with thought experiments: if overnight every person’s stock of money doubled, people would initially feel wealthier and try to spend more, but with no change in the real quantity of goods, prices would soon double as well. Ultimately, the economy would be in the same real state as before, just with all prices (and monetary values) scaled up. The real output, employment, and relative prices would be unchanged – only the monetary values differ. This parable encapsulates the classical dichotomy by showing that real wealth hasn’t changed even though nominal money holdings did.\n\n\n\nFrom the classical dichotomy stems the principle of the neutrality of money. Money is said to be neutral if changes in the stock of money have no effect on real economic variables (like real output or the real interest rate), affecting only nominal variables (like the price level or nominal incomes). In the classical theory, with flexible prices and wages, money is neutral even in the short run. A change in the money supply – whether through gold discoveries in a classical gold standard economy or open-market operations by a central bank – will proportionally change all money prices but leave real production and consumption decisions unaltered[6].\nLong-run monetary neutrality is a core implication: for example, a permanent doubling of the money supply is predicted to eventually lead to a doubling of the price level (a 100% inflation), with real GDP, employment, and real interest rates returning to their original levels[7]. In classical thought, this adjustment happens relatively quickly as prices are fully flexible. All agents understand that only nominal values have changed, so there is no lasting effect on output or other real magnitudes.\nHow does this adjustment occur? We can think in terms of supply and demand for money. Suppose the economy’s real output \\(Y\\) and money demand behavior are initially given, and the central bank unexpectedly doubles the money supply (\\(M\\)). At the old price level \\(P_0\\), there is now excess supply of money – people have more money than they desire to hold relative to goods. They will try to get rid of the excess money balances by increasing spending on goods and services (or purchasing assets). This creates an excess demand for goods (equivalently, an excess demand for all non-money assets) by Walras’ Law[8]. With more money chasing the same amount of goods, prices begin to rise. Higher prices reduce the real purchasing power of the excess money, thereby reducing the excess money balances. The price level will continue to rise until the real value of the money supply \\(M/P\\) has increased enough that people are willing to hold the entire new money supply. At the new equilibrium, the price level \\(P_1\\) will be higher (in fact, roughly double \\(P_0\\) in this scenario), such that the ratio \\(M/P\\) is restored to the original real money demand. Real variables (the quantity of goods produced and consumed) remain the same, but all nominal prices have doubled. Essentially, the equilibrium shifts from \\((M_0, P_0)\\) to \\((M_1, P_1)\\), with \\(M_1 = 2 M_0\\) and \\(P_1 \\approx 2 P_0\\), so that the real money supply \\(M_1/P_1\\) equals the original \\(M_0/P_0\\).\nTo visualize money neutrality, consider a simple money market diagram (value of money on the vertical axis and quantity of money on the horizontal axis). The demand for money is downward sloping in terms of the value of money (i.e. \\(1/P\\)) – at higher price levels (lower \\(1/P\\)), people need to hold more nominal money for transactions, so the demand for nominal balances increases as \\(1/P\\) falls. The supply of money is fixed exogenously by the central bank (a vertical line at the given \\(M\\)). Equilibrium occurs where money supply equals money demand, determining the equilibrium \\(1/P\\). Now, if the money supply increases (the vertical line shifts to the right), the intersection with the demand curve moves downward – the equilibrium value of money \\(1/P\\) falls, which means the price level \\(P\\) rises in proportion to the increase in \\(M\\). The following figure illustrates this outcome:\nIllustration: Equilibrium in the money market determines the value of money (the inverse of the price level). The demand for money (\\(D_M\\)) is downward sloping in terms of \\(1/P\\), and the money supply (\\(S_M\\)) is vertical (fixed by policy). An increase in the money supply from \\(M_0\\) to \\(M_1\\) shifts the supply curve rightward, causing the equilibrium value of money to drop from \\(1/P_0\\) to \\(1/P_1\\) – equivalently, the price level \\(P\\) rises. In classical theory, real output (\\(Y\\)) and money demand parameters are unchanged, so this change in \\(P\\) leaves real variables unaffected.[9]\nIn the classical long-run perspective, empirical evidence does show that countries with persistently higher money growth tend to have higher inflation, consistent with money neutrality in the long term. Cross-country studies find a close one-to-one relationship between the rate of money growth (in excess of real GDP growth) and the inflation rate in the long run[10]. For example, during episodes of hyperinflation, excessive money creation clearly leads to soaring prices: Zimbabwe’s central bank, by printing money in the 2000s, contributed to one of the worst hyperinflations on record – at its peak in 2008, prices in Zimbabwe were estimated to be rising at an astronomical rate of 500 billion percent per year[11]. Such extreme cases demonstrate that pouring huge amounts of money into an economy with limited output will drastically reduce money’s value (raise the price level). In more moderate circumstances too, “if the money supply grows too big relative to the size of an economy, the unit value of the currency diminishes – its purchasing power falls and prices rise”[12], which is precisely the quantity theory prediction.\nIt should be noted, however, that classical theory abstracts from short-run frictions. In reality, prices and wages may not adjust immediately (they can be sticky in the short run), so a sudden increase in the money supply might temporarily boost real activity – a possibility acknowledged even by later monetarist economists[13]. The classical model, though, assumes away these short-run rigidities, focusing on the ultimate outcome after prices have fully adjusted. In that full-adjustment scenario, money is neutral: aside from the price level and other nominal values, nothing real has changed.\n\n\n\nTo determine the price level in a monetary economy, classical economists augmented the Walrasian real system with an equation describing money demand – famously formulated by the Cambridge school of economists (Alfred Marshall, A.C. Pigou, and even a young John Maynard Keynes) in the early 1900s. The Cambridge equation (or cash-balance equation) focuses on the demand for money as a proportion of income. It can be expressed as:\nwhere \\(M^d\\) is the desired nominal money holdings (money demand), \\(P\\) is the general price level, \\(Y\\) is real national income (real output), and \\(k\\) is a parameter representing the fraction of nominal income that people wish to hold in the form of money (their cash holding ratio). In equilibrium, we assume the money market clears, so the supply of money \\(M\\) equals money demand \\(M^d\\). Thus, the Cambridge equilibrium condition is:\nThis simple equation embodies the idea that people plan to hold a certain proportion \\(k\\) of their income in cash balances for convenience and safety. The value of \\(k\\) reflects factors like payment habits, financial technology, and preferences for liquidity – for example, if people keep one month’s worth of income as cash on average, \\(k\\) might be about \\(1/12 \\approx 0.08\\). The velocity of money \\(V\\) is the inverse of this cash-balance ratio: . Velocity \\(V\\) measures how many times per period the average unit of currency is spent on final goods and services (i.e. how quickly money circulates). If \\(k=0.1\\), then \\(V=10\\), meaning each dollar (or pound, etc.) is used to purchase 10 dollars’ worth of output per period on average.\nThe Cambridge equation can be rewritten to make the price level the subject:\nThis tells us that for a given real output \\(Y\\) and given money demand parameter \\(k\\), the price level \\(P\\) adjusts in proportion to the money supply \\(M\\). In other words, the quantity of money in circulation relative to the economy’s output (adjusted by how much money people want to hold) determines the price level. If the money supply doubles, then unless there is a change in \\(Y\\) or \\(k\\), the price level must double to maintain the equality \\(M = k P Y\\). In the classical model, \\(Y\\) is determined by real factors (and in the long run by things like technology and resources), and \\(k\\) is assumed to be stable (or exogenously given by institutions and preferences). Therefore, any change in \\(M\\) translates to an proportional change in \\(P\\). This Cambridge equation thus fills the gap in the Walrasian system: whereas the Walrasian real equilibrium couldn’t pin down the absolute level of prices, adding the money market equilibrium condition (\\(M\\) supply equals \\(M^d = kPY\\) demand) yields a solution for the nominal price level[14]. The classical dichotomy is evident here – the real variable \\(Y\\) is solved elsewhere, and once \\(Y\\) is known, the nominal variable \\(P\\) adjusts to satisfy the money equation given \\(M\\).\nIt’s worth noting that the Cambridge cash-balance approach is just a different perspective on the quantity theory of money, emphasizing money demand instead of supply. Unlike the “transactions” version of the quantity theory (associated with American economist Irving Fisher, discussed next), which treats velocity as given and focuses on the flow of money spending, the Cambridge equation arises from thinking about how much of their income people wish to hold in monetary form at any time. Both approaches, however, arrive at a similar conclusion: a linkage between the money supply and nominal income. Indeed, if we take the Cambridge equation and multiply both sides by \\(V = 1/k\\), we get \\(M \\cdot V = P \\cdot Y\\). Thus the Cambridge equation is mathematically equivalent to the more famous equation of exchange, as long as we identify \\(V = 1/k\\)[15]. The two formulations differ subtly in interpretation – the classical (Fisherian) view tends to treat \\(V\\) as a constant technical parameter and money as only a medium of exchange, whereas the Cambridge view gives \\(k\\) (hence \\(V\\)) a behavioral interpretation and recognizes money’s role as a store of value that people may desire to hold. But in the strict classical theory, \\(k\\) (and hence \\(V\\)) was taken to be fairly stable in the short run, so the distinction did not undermine the overall prediction.\n\n\n\nThe Quantity Theory of Money is the centerpiece of classical monetary theory. It is often summarized by the equation of exchange:\nHere \\(M\\) is the money supply, \\(V\\) is the velocity of money, \\(P\\) is the price level, and \\(Y\\) is real output (often \\(Y\\) is taken to be real GDP for the whole economy). This equation is an identity – it defines velocity \\(V\\) as the ratio of nominal GDP (\\(P \\times Y\\)) to the money stock \\(M\\). It says that the total amount of money multiplied by the number of times each unit of money is used to buy goods (velocity) equals the total monetary value of goods purchased (\\(P \\times Y\\)) in the economy. As an accounting statement, this always holds true by construction in any given period.\nThe equation of exchange becomes a powerful theory (the QTM) with one key additional assumption: velocity \\(V\\) is constant (or at least predictable), and independent of other variables, and real output \\(Y\\) is determined by non-monetary factors (e.g. resources and technology, as in the Walrasian real system). Under these assumptions, any change in \\(M\\) must be reflected primarily in \\(P\\). In growth rate form, the quantity theory predicts that the inflation rate (growth of \\(P\\)) will equal the growth rate of money minus the growth rate of real output (since \\(V\\) is constant)[16]. For example, if the money supply grows 5% per year and real GDP grows 2% per year, QTM would predict roughly 3% annual inflation in the long run (5% – 2% = 3%). In short, the Quantity Theory of Money posits a direct, proportional relationship between the money supply and the price level, when other factors are held constant[17]. It is “one of the oldest hypotheses in economics,” linking excessive money growth to inflation[18][19].\nA classical quantity theorist typically assumes that \\(V\\) is stable due to institutions or habits (for instance, people might get paid monthly and pay bills monthly, implying a regular turnover of money). Empirically, velocity does change over time, but in early 20th century economies it was often sufficiently stable in the short run that treating it as roughly constant was not a bad approximation[20]. Meanwhile, \\(Y\\) in the long run is determined by labor, capital, technology, etc., not by the money supply. Therefore, increases in \\(M\\) lead to proportionate increases in \\(P\\). This formalizes the intuition behind money neutrality. As an IMF explainer succinctly put it, “if the money supply grows too big relative to the size of an economy, the unit value of the currency diminishes – its purchasing power falls and prices rise”[12]. The Quantity Theory thus provides a mechanism for how inflation can be controlled by controlling money growth. It underlies the famous maxim by Milton Friedman (a leading 20th-century monetarist) that “inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.”\nHistorical example: The QTM was vividly demonstrated during the Great Inflation of the 1970s. In the United States and United Kingdom, rapid growth of the money supply was accompanied by surging prices. Monetarist economists, reviving the classical QTM, argued that to bring down inflation, central banks needed to restrain money growth. Indeed, in 1979 the U.S. Federal Reserve under Paul Volcker dramatically changed policy to target the money supply growth rate. By limiting money growth, the Fed was able to squeeze inflation out of the system by the early 1980s, albeit at the cost of a recession[21]. Similarly, the U.K. adopted monetarist policies under Margaret Thatcher. These policy episodes were inspired directly by QTM logic – essentially applying classical theory to practice – and they lend support to the long-run link between money and prices. Many countries thereafter maintained a focus on low money growth to keep inflation low (until the practice of inflation targeting eventually replaced direct money targets, as discussed later).\nAnother dramatic example is the relationship between money growth and hyperinflation. We mentioned Zimbabwe’s hyperinflation; similarly, classic case studies like the Weimar German hyperinflation of 1923 show a clear QTM pattern. In Weimar Germany, the government massively increased the paper money supply to finance expenses, and the price level exploded in proportion, to the point where money became nearly worthless. Such episodes reinforce that, when taken to extremes, money growth and inflation go hand-in-hand.\nIt’s important to realize that the Quantity Theory of Money (QTM), as used in classical theory, is more than just the identity \\(MV=PY\\). It is the hypothesis that causality runs from left to right: the money supply is exogenous (determined by the central bank or gold supply) and is the primary driver of nominal GDP and the price level in the long run, with velocity and real GDP growth taken as given. The QTM assumes long-run neutrality (money only affects \\(P\\)) and often also assumes dichotomy (that real output \\(Y\\) is determined independently). Under these conditions, controlling inflation is as simple as controlling money supply growth. Monetarist economists in the 20th century extended this classical theory, asserting that a stable money growth rule would lead to stable prices[22][23]. They pointed to statistical correlations between money and prices, and argued, for example, that the Great Depression of the 1930s in the U.S. was largely due to a sharp contraction of the money stock (a thesis advanced by Friedman and Schwartz in A Monetary History of the United States[24]).\nThe QTM has seen a resurgence in debate in recent years. After the Global Financial Crisis of 2007–09, central banks injected unprecedented amounts of money into economies (through quantitative easing), yet inflation in many advanced economies remained subdued for a long time in the 2010s. This led some to question whether the classical quantity relation had broken down, as velocity appeared to decline. However, following the COVID-19 pandemic, money growth spiked again (for example, U.S. M2 money supply grew over 25% year-on-year at one point in 2020), and by 2021–2022 inflation jumped to multi-decade highs. Analysts noted that a simple quantity-theoretic linkage between money and inflation seemed to reassert itself during this period[25]. In fact, a basic model using money growth did successfully signal the rise of inflation post-2020, even though it had failed to predict inflation in the prior two decades of low inflation[26][16]. This mixed record underscores that the QTM holds well under some circumstances (especially when there are large swings in money growth and when the economy is near full capacity), but can be less reliable in others – a point we now examine as we discuss the limitations of the classical view.\n\n\n\nWhile the classical theory of money provides a useful benchmark and is largely borne out in the long run, economists have long identified several limitations and caveats to its applicability. In practice, the strict classical dichotomy and money neutrality do not always hold, especially in the short run or under certain conditions. Here are some key limitations and challenges to the classical view:\nShort-Run Non-Neutrality and Price Stickiness: The classical model assumes fully flexible prices and wages that instantaneously clear markets. In reality, many prices (e.g. wages in contracts, or prices set by firms) adjust slowly. In the presence of such sticky prices, changes in the money supply can have short-term real effects. This was a central insight of John Maynard Keynes and later Keynesian economics: if the money supply increases, in the short run it may lower interest rates and stimulate investment and consumption, thus increasing real output and employment – contrary to neutrality. Only over time, as prices gradually adjust, will the full effect be reflected in the price level. Keynesians argue that during recessions or periods of slack, output is demand-determined, and an increase in money (and thus demand) can raise output rather than prices. The classical dichotomy is thus violated in the short run: real and nominal variables are intertwined. Modern empirical research confirms that money is not neutral in the short term – for instance, expansionary monetary policy often boosts real GDP for a couple of years before inflation catches up. Even monetarist economists accept the idea of short-run monetary nonneutrality due to lags in price adjustment[13]. The long-run neutrality may still hold, but the journey matters for economic fluctuations.\nUnstable Velocity and Money Demand: The classical QTM assumes velocity (\\(V\\)) or the Cambridge \\(k\\) is fixed (or at least exogenous and stable). In reality, velocity can and does change due to various factors – interest rates, financial innovation, payment technologies, and economic uncertainty can all affect how much money people want to hold relative to income. Keynes, in his critique of the classical theory, introduced the idea of speculative demand for money (part of his liquidity preference theory), suggesting that \\(k\\) is not a constant but depends on the interest rate: when interest rates are low, people are less incentivized to hold bonds and more content holding money, so money demand rises (velocity falls), and vice versa. He also noted that expectations of deflation or financial turmoil can make people hoard cash (increasing \\(k\\) dramatically). In symbolic form, Keynesians might express money demand as \\(M^d = k(i) \\, P \\, Y\\), where \\(k\\) is a function of the nominal interest rate \\(i\\) (and perhaps other variables like expectations of inflation)[27]. This view implies that velocity is endogenous and can vary widely – which undermines the simple classical QTM prediction. Indeed, Keynesians attach little or no significance to a rigid quantity theory rule precisely because velocity is inherently unstable[28]. Empirical history vindicates this concern: for example, in the 1980s, financial deregulation and innovation in banking altered the stability of money demand in the US and UK, causing velocity of traditional aggregates (like \\(M1\\) or \\(M2\\)) to shift unpredictably. During the 1990s and 2000s, the rise of credit cards, money market funds, and later digital payment platforms continued to change money holding patterns. Central banks found that targeting a money supply growth rate (as suggested by monetarism) became unreliable because the relationship between money, output, and prices was weakening – the money demand function was shifting. This is one reason why central banks moved away from strict money supply targets to interest rate targets and inflation targeting frameworks by the 1990s: the link between measured money supply and inflation became harder to discern in real time[29][30].\nEmpirical Variability in the Money-Inflation Relationship: The long-run correlation between money growth and inflation is strong across broad samples and extreme cases, but over shorter horizons and moderate inflation environments the relationship can be obscured by other factors. Studies have found that when inflation is low and stable, money growth often does not closely predict inflation – velocity may fluctuate or other forces (like supply/demand shocks) dominate short-run inflation dynamics[31]. For instance, in the two decades before the 2020s, many advanced economies saw relatively high growth in central bank money (due to quantitative easing) but inflation remained low, as much of the new money was effectively stored in banks as excess reserves or was offset by declines in money velocity. A Dallas Fed analysis noted that a simple money-growth-based model would have badly under-predicted or over-predicted inflation in those years, reflecting an unstable relationship between money and inflation in environments where inflation expectations are anchored[32]. This does not invalidate the QTM in the long run, but it shows that the short-to-medium run link can loosen. When the regime changes – as in 2021 when inflation re-emerged – the link appeared to strengthen again, reminding us that context matters[17][33]. The BIS (Bank for International Settlements) recently reported that money growth tends to be a more reliable indicator of inflation during high-inflation regimes than in low-inflation regimes[31]. In summary, the QTM’s assumption of a stable velocity is more of a conditional truth; velocity can be volatile, and policy must take that into account.\nDefinition of Money and Financial Innovation: Classical theory assumes a clear definition of “money” – often implicitly referring to currency or a narrow aggregate. In practice, money comes in different forms (cash, checking deposits, savings accounts, money market funds, etc.), and the boundary between money and other financial assets can shift. If people move funds between money and near-money assets, the effective money supply for transactions might change even if base money doesn’t, affecting velocity calculations. Over the years, definitions like \\(M1\\), \\(M2\\), \\(M3\\) were created, and their velocities behaved differently. The classical story is simplified and doesn’t fully capture these complexities of a modern credit-based monetary system where commercial banks create money (via lending) and central bank control is mostly indirect. It turned out to be challenging to find a monetary aggregate that has both a stable velocity and strong link to inflation in real time. This is another reason why central banks in practice target interest rates rather than the money supply nowadays – they can more directly influence economic conditions through rates, whereas controlling money growth alone proved insufficient when velocity shifted. The classical theory’s implications remain true in the long run (too much broad money growth will eventually cause inflation), but short-run monetary policy must deal with uncertainty in money demand.\nEconomic Conditions (Liquidity Traps and Confidence): In some extreme situations, changes in the money supply may have little effect on either prices or output – a situation known as a liquidity trap. This occurs, for example, when interest rates are near zero and investors have essentially infinite demand for liquidity (money) at that rate. In a liquidity trap (as during the Great Depression or Japan in the 1990s or globally in the late 2000s), increasing the money supply might simply lead to people holding more cash (an increase in \\(k\\)) with no increase in spending – thus neither output nor prices rise much. This scenario is outside the classical theory, which assumes away such pathological cases. It required Keynesian analysis to explain: when confidence is shattered and interest rates are at the lower bound, the classical dichotomy breaks down completely – money is non-neutral even in potentially long periods because prices may even fall (deflation) despite monetary expansion. Fortunately, such traps are rare, but the possibility highlights that the neutrality of money is not a universal law but a conditional outcome.\nIntegration with Real Finance and Interest Rates: The classical theory in its pure form abstracts from how money interacts with interest rates and asset markets. In reality, a change in the money supply can affect interest rates (at least in the short run before prices adjust), which in turn can affect investment and consumption. The classical model assumed the loanable funds market adjusts interest rates based on saving and investment, independent of the money supply. However, if the central bank injects money, it may temporarily lower interest rates (if we hold prices fixed in the very short run), causing real effects – this is essentially the Keynesian transmission mechanism. Modern New Classical and New Keynesian models have incorporated money or monetary policy into a broader framework with interest rate rules and expectations, something the simplistic classical model does not do.\nContemporary challenges – Digital Currencies: A very modern consideration is how digital currencies and fintech innovations affect the classical theory. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, or central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), represent new forms of money (or quasi-money). Do they change the quantity theory? So far, there is no evidence that they overturn basic monetary principles – the classical logic would still apply to an economy’s overall money supply broadly defined. For instance, one empirical study found “no change in velocity or the money multiplier after the rise of cryptocurrencies”, suggesting that the advent of crypto has not materially altered aggregate money demand or the effectiveness of monetary policy[34]. However, digital innovations can affect \\(k\\) in the Cambridge equation by making transactions easier (potentially raising velocity) or introducing alternative assets that serve some functions of money. Central banks are closely watching these developments. The consensus is that while the forms of money are evolving, the fundamental constraint – that if too much liquidity chases too few goods, the value of money will drop – remains as true as ever. Digital currencies might change how we measure and control the money supply, but they do not negate the classical long-run link between money and prices.\nIn light of these limitations, modern macroeconomists view the classical theory of money as a long-run benchmark rather than a complete description for all time horizons. It offers a valid intuition for why sustained money growth leads to inflation (and conversely, why controlling money growth can stabilize prices). However, for short-run analysis and policy design, we use more elaborate frameworks that account for price stickiness, expectations, and financial frictions (for example, the IS-LM model in Keynesian tradition or New Keynesian dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models). These frameworks relax the classical dichotomy – allowing monetary policy to have real effects in the short run – while typically still embedding long-run neutrality of money as a special case. Central banks today generally target inflation directly (often through interest-rate policy) rather than the money supply, implicitly acknowledging that velocity is unstable in the short run. Yet, the spirit of the quantity theory survives: central bankers recognize that excessive money creation will ultimately be inflationary[35], and keeping inflation low and stable in the long run requires not letting money grow far out of line with the economy’s capacity to produce goods and services.\n\n\n\nWalrasian Foundations: The classical theory is built on a Walrasian general equilibrium of the real economy, where flexible prices ensure all markets clear. In a barter setting, only relative prices are determined; a purely real model cannot pin down the absolute price level[2].\nMoney as a Veil: Introducing money separates real and nominal variables. The classical dichotomy holds that real economic outcomes (output, relative prices, real interest rates) are determined by real factors, independent of the money supply[5]. Money provides a unit of account and medium of exchange but is a “veil” over the real economy – changing the money supply only changes nominal prices, not the real allocation of resources[1].\nNeutrality of Money: In the classical view, money is neutral in both the long run and (in the absence of frictions) the short run. A change in the money supply leads to an equal proportional change in the price level and other nominal values, leaving real GDP, employment, and real interest rates unaffected[6]. This implies that inflation is fundamentally a monetary phenomenon in the long term. Historical episodes of high inflation underscore this one-to-one link between money growth and prices[36][11].\nCambridge Equation and QTM: The classical theory determines the price level via the Cambridge cash-balance equation \\(M = kPY\\), which is equivalent to the quantity equation \\(MV = PY\\) with \\(V = 1/k\\). This formalizes the Quantity Theory of Money (QTM) – assuming stable velocity (or cash-holding ratio \\(k\\)) and exogenous output, the money supply governs the nominal GDP and price level[15][17]. Excess money supply, given output, bids up prices until money market equilibrium is restored.\nContemporary Relevance: The classical theory provides a crucial baseline for thinking about inflation and monetary policy. It correctly predicts that countries with persistently rapid money growth (relative to output) experience high inflation[37]. Monetarist policies in the 1970s–80s were inspired by this theory and had success in curbing inflation by restraining money growth[21]. Even today, surges in the money supply (e.g. during the COVID-19 crisis) are closely watched for inflationary impact[25].\nLimitations: In practice, the strict classical dichotomy breaks down in the short run. Because of sticky prices, variable velocity, and financial complexities, money is not always neutral in the short-to-medium term. Velocity can shift due to changes in interest rates or public confidence, weakening the link between money and prices[28][32]. Accordingly, modern central banks target inflation via interest rates and other tools rather than fixing the money supply growth alone. The classical theory is best viewed as a long-run anchor – in the long run, excessive money creation will cause inflation – but with the understanding that short-run dynamics can deviate from the classical predictions.\n\n\n\nAtkinson, T. and Mau, R.

    "text": "The classical theory of money is an approach in macroeconomics asserting that money primarily influences nominal variables (prices, wages) and has negligible effect on real economic activity (output, employment) in the long run. Classical economists often say “money is a veil”, meaning that the system of money prices may obscure real economic relationships, but in reality the underlying real economy is unchanged by the quantity of money in circulation[1]. This theory, rooted in the 19th-century Walrasian general equilibrium framework and the early 20th-century Quantity Theory of Money, underpins the view that sustained changes in the money supply lead to proportional changes in the price level, with real variables determined by real factors like technology and preferences. In this reading, we outline the classical model of a monetary economy and its key implications – the Walrasian system of general equilibrium, the classical dichotomy between real and monetary sectors, the neutrality of money, the Cambridge equation of exchange, and the Quantity Theory of Money (QTM) – and discuss how these ideas hold up with contemporary examples. We also examine the limitations of the classical view, including situations (such as short-run economic fluctuations or extreme policy environments) where money may not be neutral and why modern economists and central banks have nuanced this theory.",

    "text": "Classical theory builds on the Walrasian general equilibrium model of a barter economy (named after Léon Walras, 1834–1910, a pioneer of mathematical economics). In a Walrasian system, all markets for goods and services simultaneously clear through price adjustment. Formally, it consists of a set of market-clearing conditions (one for each good or factor) and a corresponding set of relative prices that adjust to equate supply and demand in every market[2]. Importantly, only relative prices matter in this system – prices are expressed in terms of one another (for instance, how many units of good A trade for one unit of good B). One good can be chosen as a numéraire (unit of account) to price all other goods, fixing the scale for relative prices.\nBecause all prices in Walrasian equilibrium are determined only up to a common scale, the model exhibits homogeneity: if all prices were doubled (or halved), the real allocations of goods would remain the same. This implies that in a purely real economy without money, the absolute price level is indeterminate – there is no unique solution for “the” price level, only for relative prices. In other words, the Walrasian model determines what and how much gets produced and consumed (real output and relative price ratios), but not the overall monetary value of those goods. Walras’ Law holds that if all but one markets are in equilibrium, the last market must also clear (excess supply in one market must be matched by excess demand in at least one other), ensuring consistency of the general equilibrium[3][4].\nIn this frictionless, barter-style economy, real variables – such as real output, the allocation of goods, and relative prices – are determined entirely by real factors (preferences, endowments, technology) without any reference to the money supply. This is the foundation of the classical idea that money is nonessential in determining real economic outcomes. However, to analyze an economy with money (a monetary economy), we need to introduce money into the Walrasian system in a way that pins down the general price level.",

    "text": "The introduction of money into the model leads to what is known as the classical dichotomy – a strict separation between the determination of real variables and nominal variables. According to the classical dichotomy, real variables (such as real GDP, real consumption, employment, and relative prices of goods) are determined independently of nominal variables (such as the absolute price level, inflation rate, and nominal money supply)[5]. In practical terms, one can first solve for the real equilibrium of the economy (the allocation of resources and relative prices as if it were a barter economy), and then determine the nominal price level by considering the money market. The presence of money serves only to convert the barter terms of trade into monetary terms; it does not alter the underlying real equilibrium.\nThis dichotomy reflects the notion that money is neutral in its effect on the real economy, an idea we explore more below. In the classical view, money’s sole function in general equilibrium is to determine the units in which prices are quoted – essentially acting as a unit of account and medium of exchange without changing real outcomes. Walras’s model extended to include money treats money as an additional “good” for which supply and demand must equilibrate, but crucially, changes in the supply of money do not affect the equilibrium quantities of other goods or relative prices (they only affect absolute nominal prices). The system of equations describing the economy can thus be partitioned into a real subsystem and a monetary subsystem, with minimal feedback from the monetary side to the real side – this is the essence of the classical dichotomy[5].\nHistorically, classical economists like David Hume illustrated the dichotomy with thought experiments: if overnight every person’s stock of money doubled, people would initially feel wealthier and try to spend more, but with no change in the real quantity of goods, prices would soon double as well. Ultimately, the economy would be in the same real state as before, just with all prices (and monetary values) scaled up. The real output, employment, and relative prices would be unchanged – only the monetary values differ. This parable encapsulates the classical dichotomy by showing that real wealth hasn’t changed even though nominal money holdings did.",

    "text": "From the classical dichotomy stems the principle of the neutrality of money. Money is said to be neutral if changes in the stock of money have no effect on real economic variables (like real output or the real interest rate), affecting only nominal variables (like the price level or nominal incomes). In the classical theory, with flexible prices and wages, money is neutral even in the short run. A change in the money supply – whether through gold discoveries in a classical gold standard economy or open-market operations by a central bank – will proportionally change all money prices but leave real production and consumption decisions unaltered[6].\nLong-run monetary neutrality is a core implication: for example, a permanent doubling of the money supply is predicted to eventually lead to a doubling of the price level (a 100% inflation), with real GDP, employment, and real interest rates returning to their original levels[7]. In classical thought, this adjustment happens relatively quickly as prices are fully flexible. All agents understand that only nominal values have changed, so there is no lasting effect on output or other real magnitudes.\nHow does this adjustment occur? We can think in terms of supply and demand for money. Suppose the economy’s real output \\(Y\\) and money demand behavior are initially given, and the central bank unexpectedly doubles the money supply (\\(M\\)). At the old price level \\(P_0\\), there is now excess supply of money – people have more money than they desire to hold relative to goods. They will try to get rid of the excess money balances by increasing spending on goods and services (or purchasing assets). This creates an excess demand for goods (equivalently, an excess demand for all non-money assets) by Walras’ Law[8]. With more money chasing the same amount of goods, prices begin to rise. Higher prices reduce the real purchasing power of the excess money, thereby reducing the excess money balances. The price level will continue to rise until the real value of the money supply \\(M/P\\) has increased enough that people are willing to hold the entire new money supply. At the new equilibrium, the price level \\(P_1\\) will be higher (in fact, roughly double \\(P_0\\) in this scenario), such that the ratio \\(M/P\\) is restored to the original real money demand. Real variables (the quantity of goods produced and consumed) remain the same, but all nominal prices have doubled. Essentially, the equilibrium shifts from \\((M_0, P_0)\\) to \\((M_1, P_1)\\), with \\(M_1 = 2 M_0\\) and \\(P_1 \\approx 2 P_0\\), so that the real money supply \\(M_1/P_1\\) equals the original \\(M_0/P_0\\).\nTo visualize money neutrality, consider a simple money market diagram (value of money on the vertical axis and quantity of money on the horizontal axis). The demand for money is downward sloping in terms of the value of money (i.e. \\(1/P\\)) – at higher price levels (lower \\(1/P\\)), people need to hold more nominal money for transactions, so the demand for nominal balances increases as \\(1/P\\) falls. The supply of money is fixed exogenously by the central bank (a vertical line at the given \\(M\\)). Equilibrium occurs where money supply equals money demand, determining the equilibrium \\(1/P\\). Now, if the money supply increases (the vertical line shifts to the right), the intersection with the demand curve moves downward – the equilibrium value of money \\(1/P\\) falls, which means the price level \\(P\\) rises in proportion to the increase in \\(M\\). The following figure illustrates this outcome:\nIllustration: Equilibrium in the money market determines the value of money (the inverse of the price level). The demand for money (\\(D_M\\)) is downward sloping in terms of \\(1/P\\), and the money supply (\\(S_M\\)) is vertical (fixed by policy). An increase in the money supply from \\(M_0\\) to \\(M_1\\) shifts the supply curve rightward, causing the equilibrium value of money to drop from \\(1/P_0\\) to \\(1/P_1\\) – equivalently, the price level \\(P\\) rises. In classical theory, real output (\\(Y\\)) and money demand parameters are unchanged, so this change in \\(P\\) leaves real variables unaffected.[9]\nIn the classical long-run perspective, empirical evidence does show that countries with persistently higher money growth tend to have higher inflation, consistent with money neutrality in the long term. Cross-country studies find a close one-to-one relationship between the rate of money growth (in excess of real GDP growth) and the inflation rate in the long run[10]. For example, during episodes of hyperinflation, excessive money creation clearly leads to soaring prices: Zimbabwe’s central bank, by printing money in the 2000s, contributed to one of the worst hyperinflations on record – at its peak in 2008, prices in Zimbabwe were estimated to be rising at an astronomical rate of 500 billion percent per year[11]. Such extreme cases demonstrate that pouring huge amounts of money into an economy with limited output will drastically reduce money’s value (raise the price level). In more moderate circumstances too, “if the money supply grows too big relative to the size of an economy, the unit value of the currency diminishes – its purchasing power falls and prices rise”[12], which is precisely the quantity theory prediction.\nIt should be noted, however, that classical theory abstracts from short-run frictions. In reality, prices and wages may not adjust immediately (they can be sticky in the short run), so a sudden increase in the money supply might temporarily boost real activity – a possibility acknowledged even by later monetarist economists[13]. The classical model, though, assumes away these short-run rigidities, focusing on the ultimate outcome after prices have fully adjusted. In that full-adjustment scenario, money is neutral: aside from the price level and other nominal values, nothing real has changed.",

    "text": "To determine the price level in a monetary economy, classical economists augmented the Walrasian real system with an equation describing money demand – famously formulated by the Cambridge school of economists (Alfred Marshall, A.C. Pigou, and even a young John Maynard Keynes) in the early 1900s. The Cambridge equation (or cash-balance equation) focuses on the demand for money as a proportion of income. It can be expressed as:\nwhere \\(M^d\\) is the desired nominal money holdings (money demand), \\(P\\) is the general price level, \\(Y\\) is real national income (real output), and \\(k\\) is a parameter representing the fraction of nominal income that people wish to hold in the form of money (their cash holding ratio). In equilibrium, we assume the money market clears, so the supply of money \\(M\\) equals money demand \\(M^d\\). Thus, the Cambridge equilibrium condition is:\nThis simple equation embodies the idea that people plan to hold a certain proportion \\(k\\) of their income in cash balances for convenience and safety. The value of \\(k\\) reflects factors like payment habits, financial technology, and preferences for liquidity – for example, if people keep one month’s worth of income as cash on average, \\(k\\) might be about \\(1/12 \\approx 0.08\\). The velocity of money \\(V\\) is the inverse of this cash-balance ratio: . Velocity \\(V\\) measures how many times per period the average unit of currency is spent on final goods and services (i.e. how quickly money circulates). If \\(k=0.1\\), then \\(V=10\\), meaning each dollar (or pound, etc.) is used to purchase 10 dollars’ worth of output per period on average.\nThe Cambridge equation can be rewritten to make the price level the subject:\nThis tells us that for a given real output \\(Y\\) and given money demand parameter \\(k\\), the price level \\(P\\) adjusts in proportion to the money supply \\(M\\). In other words, the quantity of money in circulation relative to the economy’s output (adjusted by how much money people want to hold) determines the price level. If the money supply doubles, then unless there is a change in \\(Y\\) or \\(k\\), the price level must double to maintain the equality \\(M = k P Y\\). In the classical model, \\(Y\\) is determined by real factors (and in the long run by things like technology and resources), and \\(k\\) is assumed to be stable (or exogenously given by institutions and preferences). Therefore, any change in \\(M\\) translates to an proportional change in \\(P\\). This Cambridge equation thus fills the gap in the Walrasian system: whereas the Walrasian real equilibrium couldn’t pin down the absolute level of prices, adding the money market equilibrium condition (\\(M\\) supply equals \\(M^d = kPY\\) demand) yields a solution for the nominal price level[14]. The classical dichotomy is evident here – the real variable \\(Y\\) is solved elsewhere, and once \\(Y\\) is known, the nominal variable \\(P\\) adjusts to satisfy the money equation given \\(M\\).\nIt’s worth noting that the Cambridge cash-balance approach is just a different perspective on the quantity theory of money, emphasizing money demand instead of supply. Unlike the “transactions” version of the quantity theory (associated with American economist Irving Fisher, discussed next), which treats velocity as given and focuses on the flow of money spending, the Cambridge equation arises from thinking about how much of their income people wish to hold in monetary form at any time. Both approaches, however, arrive at a similar conclusion: a linkage between the money supply and nominal income. Indeed, if we take the Cambridge equation and multiply both sides by \\(V = 1/k\\), we get \\(M \\cdot V = P \\cdot Y\\). Thus the Cambridge equation is mathematically equivalent to the more famous equation of exchange, as long as we identify \\(V = 1/k\\)[15]. The two formulations differ subtly in interpretation – the classical (Fisherian) view tends to treat \\(V\\) as a constant technical parameter and money as only a medium of exchange, whereas the Cambridge view gives \\(k\\) (hence \\(V\\)) a behavioral interpretation and recognizes money’s role as a store of value that people may desire to hold. But in the strict classical theory, \\(k\\) (and hence \\(V\\)) was taken to be fairly stable in the short run, so the distinction did not undermine the overall prediction.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "The Quantity Theory of Money is the centerpiece of classical monetary theory. It is often summarized by the equation of exchange:\nHere \\(M\\) is the money supply, \\(V\\) is the velocity of money, \\(P\\) is the price level, and \\(Y\\) is real output (often \\(Y\\) is taken to be real GDP for the whole economy). This equation is an identity – it defines velocity \\(V\\) as the ratio of nominal GDP (\\(P \\times Y\\)) to the money stock \\(M\\). It says that the total amount of money multiplied by the number of times each unit of money is used to buy goods (velocity) equals the total monetary value of goods purchased (\\(P \\times Y\\)) in the economy. As an accounting statement, this always holds true by construction in any given period.\nThe equation of exchange becomes a powerful theory (the QTM) with one key additional assumption: velocity \\(V\\) is constant (or at least predictable), and independent of other variables, and real output \\(Y\\) is determined by non-monetary factors (e.g. resources and technology, as in the Walrasian real system). Under these assumptions, any change in \\(M\\) must be reflected primarily in \\(P\\). In growth rate form, the quantity theory predicts that the inflation rate (growth of \\(P\\)) will equal the growth rate of money minus the growth rate of real output (since \\(V\\) is constant)[16]. For example, if the money supply grows 5% per year and real GDP grows 2% per year, QTM would predict roughly 3% annual inflation in the long run (5% – 2% = 3%). In short, the Quantity Theory of Money posits a direct, proportional relationship between the money supply and the price level, when other factors are held constant[17]. It is “one of the oldest hypotheses in economics,” linking excessive money growth to inflation[18][19].\nA classical quantity theorist typically assumes that \\(V\\) is stable due to institutions or habits (for instance, people might get paid monthly and pay bills monthly, implying a regular turnover of money). Empirically, velocity does change over time, but in early 20th century economies it was often sufficiently stable in the short run that treating it as roughly constant was not a bad approximation[20]. Meanwhile, \\(Y\\) in the long run is determined by labor, capital, technology, etc., not by the money supply. Therefore, increases in \\(M\\) lead to proportionate increases in \\(P\\). This formalizes the intuition behind money neutrality. As an IMF explainer succinctly put it, “if the money supply grows too big relative to the size of an economy, the unit value of the currency diminishes – its purchasing power falls and prices rise”[12]. The Quantity Theory thus provides a mechanism for how inflation can be controlled by controlling money growth. It underlies the famous maxim by Milton Friedman (a leading 20th-century monetarist) that “inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.”\nHistorical example: The QTM was vividly demonstrated during the Great Inflation of the 1970s. In the United States and United Kingdom, rapid growth of the money supply was accompanied by surging prices. Monetarist economists, reviving the classical QTM, argued that to bring down inflation, central banks needed to restrain money growth. Indeed, in 1979 the U.S. Federal Reserve under Paul Volcker dramatically changed policy to target the money supply growth rate. By limiting money growth, the Fed was able to squeeze inflation out of the system by the early 1980s, albeit at the cost of a recession[21]. Similarly, the U.K. adopted monetarist policies under Margaret Thatcher. These policy episodes were inspired directly by QTM logic – essentially applying classical theory to practice – and they lend support to the long-run link between money and prices. Many countries thereafter maintained a focus on low money growth to keep inflation low (until the practice of inflation targeting eventually replaced direct money targets, as discussed later).\nAnother dramatic example is the relationship between money growth and hyperinflation. We mentioned Zimbabwe’s hyperinflation; similarly, classic case studies like the Weimar German hyperinflation of 1923 show a clear QTM pattern. In Weimar Germany, the government massively increased the paper money supply to finance expenses, and the price level exploded in proportion, to the point where money became nearly worthless. Such episodes reinforce that, when taken to extremes, money growth and inflation go hand-in-hand.\nIt’s important to realize that the Quantity Theory of Money (QTM), as used in classical theory, is more than just the identity \\(MV=PY\\). It is the hypothesis that causality runs from left to right: the money supply is exogenous (determined by the central bank or gold supply) and is the primary driver of nominal GDP and the price level in the long run, with velocity and real GDP growth taken as given. The QTM assumes long-run neutrality (money only affects \\(P\\)) and often also assumes dichotomy (that real output \\(Y\\) is determined independently). Under these conditions, controlling inflation is as simple as controlling money supply growth. Monetarist economists in the 20th century extended this classical theory, asserting that a stable money growth rule would lead to stable prices[22][23]. They pointed to statistical correlations between money and prices, and argued, for example, that the Great Depression of the 1930s in the U.S. was largely due to a sharp contraction of the money stock (a thesis advanced by Friedman and Schwartz in A Monetary History of the United States[24]).\nThe QTM has seen a resurgence in debate in recent years. After the Global Financial Crisis of 2007–09, central banks injected unprecedented amounts of money into economies (through quantitative easing), yet inflation in many advanced economies remained subdued for a long time in the 2010s. This led some to question whether the classical quantity relation had broken down, as velocity appeared to decline. However, following the COVID-19 pandemic, money growth spiked again (for example, U.S. M2 money supply grew over 25% year-on-year at one point in 2020), and by 2021–2022 inflation jumped to multi-decade highs. Analysts noted that a simple quantity-theoretic linkage between money and inflation seemed to reassert itself during this period[25]. In fact, a basic model using money growth did successfully signal the rise of inflation post-2020, even though it had failed to predict inflation in the prior two decades of low inflation[26][16]. This mixed record underscores that the QTM holds well under some circumstances (especially when there are large swings in money growth and when the economy is near full capacity), but can be less reliable in others – a point we now examine as we discuss the limitations of the classical view.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "While the classical theory of money provides a useful benchmark and is largely borne out in the long run, economists have long identified several limitations and caveats to its applicability. In practice, the strict classical dichotomy and money neutrality do not always hold, especially in the short run or under certain conditions. Here are some key limitations and challenges to the classical view:\nShort-Run Non-Neutrality and Price Stickiness: The classical model assumes fully flexible prices and wages that instantaneously clear markets. In reality, many prices (e.g. wages in contracts, or prices set by firms) adjust slowly. In the presence of such sticky prices, changes in the money supply can have short-term real effects. This was a central insight of John Maynard Keynes and later Keynesian economics: if the money supply increases, in the short run it may lower interest rates and stimulate investment and consumption, thus increasing real output and employment – contrary to neutrality. Only over time, as prices gradually adjust, will the full effect be reflected in the price level. Keynesians argue that during recessions or periods of slack, output is demand-determined, and an increase in money (and thus demand) can raise output rather than prices. The classical dichotomy is thus violated in the short run: real and nominal variables are intertwined. Modern empirical research confirms that money is not neutral in the short term – for instance, expansionary monetary policy often boosts real GDP for a couple of years before inflation catches up. Even monetarist economists accept the idea of short-run monetary nonneutrality due to lags in price adjustment[13]. The long-run neutrality may still hold, but the journey matters for economic fluctuations.\nUnstable Velocity and Money Demand: The classical QTM assumes velocity (\\(V\\)) or the Cambridge \\(k\\) is fixed (or at least exogenous and stable). In reality, velocity can and does change due to various factors – interest rates, financial innovation, payment technologies, and economic uncertainty can all affect how much money people want to hold relative to income. Keynes, in his critique of the classical theory, introduced the idea of speculative demand for money (part of his liquidity preference theory), suggesting that \\(k\\) is not a constant but depends on the interest rate: when interest rates are low, people are less incentivized to hold bonds and more content holding money, so money demand rises (velocity falls), and vice versa. He also noted that expectations of deflation or financial turmoil can make people hoard cash (increasing \\(k\\) dramatically). In symbolic form, Keynesians might express money demand as \\(M^d = k(i) \\, P \\, Y\\), where \\(k\\) is a function of the nominal interest rate \\(i\\) (and perhaps other variables like expectations of inflation)[27]. This view implies that velocity is endogenous and can vary widely – which undermines the simple classical QTM prediction. Indeed, Keynesians attach little or no significance to a rigid quantity theory rule precisely because velocity is inherently unstable[28]. Empirical history vindicates this concern: for example, in the 1980s, financial deregulation and innovation in banking altered the stability of money demand in the US and UK, causing velocity of traditional aggregates (like \\(M1\\) or \\(M2\\)) to shift unpredictably. During the 1990s and 2000s, the rise of credit cards, money market funds, and later digital payment platforms continued to change money holding patterns. Central banks found that targeting a money supply growth rate (as suggested by monetarism) became unreliable because the relationship between money, output, and prices was weakening – the money demand function was shifting. This is one reason why central banks moved away from strict money supply targets to interest rate targets and inflation targeting frameworks by the 1990s: the link between measured money supply and inflation became harder to discern in real time[29][30].\nEmpirical Variability in the Money-Inflation Relationship: The long-run correlation between money growth and inflation is strong across broad samples and extreme cases, but over shorter horizons and moderate inflation environments the relationship can be obscured by other factors. Studies have found that when inflation is low and stable, money growth often does not closely predict inflation – velocity may fluctuate or other forces (like supply/demand shocks) dominate short-run inflation dynamics[31]. For instance, in the two decades before the 2020s, many advanced economies saw relatively high growth in central bank money (due to quantitative easing) but inflation remained low, as much of the new money was effectively stored in banks as excess reserves or was offset by declines in money velocity. A Dallas Fed analysis noted that a simple money-growth-based model would have badly under-predicted or over-predicted inflation in those years, reflecting an unstable relationship between money and inflation in environments where inflation expectations are anchored[32]. This does not invalidate the QTM in the long run, but it shows that the short-to-medium run link can loosen. When the regime changes – as in 2021 when inflation re-emerged – the link appeared to strengthen again, reminding us that context matters[17][33]. The BIS (Bank for International Settlements) recently reported that money growth tends to be a more reliable indicator of inflation during high-inflation regimes than in low-inflation regimes[31]. In summary, the QTM’s assumption of a stable velocity is more of a conditional truth; velocity can be volatile, and policy must take that into account.\nDefinition of Money and Financial Innovation: Classical theory assumes a clear definition of “money” – often implicitly referring to currency or a narrow aggregate. In practice, money comes in different forms (cash, checking deposits, savings accounts, money market funds, etc.), and the boundary between money and other financial assets can shift. If people move funds between money and near-money assets, the effective money supply for transactions might change even if base money doesn’t, affecting velocity calculations. Over the years, definitions like \\(M1\\), \\(M2\\), \\(M3\\) were created, and their velocities behaved differently. The classical story is simplified and doesn’t fully capture these complexities of a modern credit-based monetary system where commercial banks create money (via lending) and central bank control is mostly indirect. It turned out to be challenging to find a monetary aggregate that has both a stable velocity and strong link to inflation in real time. This is another reason why central banks in practice target interest rates rather than the money supply nowadays – they can more directly influence economic conditions through rates, whereas controlling money growth alone proved insufficient when velocity shifted. The classical theory’s implications remain true in the long run (too much broad money growth will eventually cause inflation), but short-run monetary policy must deal with uncertainty in money demand.\nEconomic Conditions (Liquidity Traps and Confidence): In some extreme situations, changes in the money supply may have little effect on either prices or output – a situation known as a liquidity trap. This occurs, for example, when interest rates are near zero and investors have essentially infinite demand for liquidity (money) at that rate. In a liquidity trap (as during the Great Depression or Japan in the 1990s or globally in the late 2000s), increasing the money supply might simply lead to people holding more cash (an increase in \\(k\\)) with no increase in spending – thus neither output nor prices rise much. This scenario is outside the classical theory, which assumes away such pathological cases. It required Keynesian analysis to explain: when confidence is shattered and interest rates are at the lower bound, the classical dichotomy breaks down completely – money is non-neutral even in potentially long periods because prices may even fall (deflation) despite monetary expansion. Fortunately, such traps are rare, but the possibility highlights that the neutrality of money is not a universal law but a conditional outcome.\nIntegration with Real Finance and Interest Rates: The classical theory in its pure form abstracts from how money interacts with interest rates and asset markets. In reality, a change in the money supply can affect interest rates (at least in the short run before prices adjust), which in turn can affect investment and consumption. The classical model assumed the loanable funds market adjusts interest rates based on saving and investment, independent of the money supply. However, if the central bank injects money, it may temporarily lower interest rates (if we hold prices fixed in the very short run), causing real effects – this is essentially the Keynesian transmission mechanism. Modern New Classical and New Keynesian models have incorporated money or monetary policy into a broader framework with interest rate rules and expectations, something the simplistic classical model does not do.\nContemporary challenges – Digital Currencies: A very modern consideration is how digital currencies and fintech innovations affect the classical theory. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, or central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), represent new forms of money (or quasi-money). Do they change the quantity theory? So far, there is no evidence that they overturn basic monetary principles – the classical logic would still apply to an economy’s overall money supply broadly defined. For instance, one empirical study found “no change in velocity or the money multiplier after the rise of cryptocurrencies”, suggesting that the advent of crypto has not materially altered aggregate money demand or the effectiveness of monetary policy[34]. However, digital innovations can affect \\(k\\) in the Cambridge equation by making transactions easier (potentially raising velocity) or introducing alternative assets that serve some functions of money. Central banks are closely watching these developments. The consensus is that while the forms of money are evolving, the fundamental constraint – that if too much liquidity chases too few goods, the value of money will drop – remains as true as ever. Digital currencies might change how we measure and control the money supply, but they do not negate the classical long-run link between money and prices.\nIn light of these limitations, modern macroeconomists view the classical theory of money as a long-run benchmark rather than a complete description for all time horizons. It offers a valid intuition for why sustained money growth leads to inflation (and conversely, why controlling money growth can stabilize prices). However, for short-run analysis and policy design, we use more elaborate frameworks that account for price stickiness, expectations, and financial frictions (for example, the IS-LM model in Keynesian tradition or New Keynesian dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models). These frameworks relax the classical dichotomy – allowing monetary policy to have real effects in the short run – while typically still embedding long-run neutrality of money as a special case. Central banks today generally target inflation directly (often through interest-rate policy) rather than the money supply, implicitly acknowledging that velocity is unstable in the short run. Yet, the spirit of the quantity theory survives: central bankers recognize that excessive money creation will ultimately be inflationary[35], and keeping inflation low and stable in the long run requires not letting money grow far out of line with the economy’s capacity to produce goods and services.",

    "text": "Walrasian Foundations: The classical theory is built on a Walrasian general equilibrium of the real economy, where flexible prices ensure all markets clear. In a barter setting, only relative prices are determined; a purely real model cannot pin down the absolute price level[2].\nMoney as a Veil: Introducing money separates real and nominal variables. The classical dichotomy holds that real economic outcomes (output, relative prices, real interest rates) are determined by real factors, independent of the money supply[5]. Money provides a unit of account and medium of exchange but is a “veil” over the real economy – changing the money supply only changes nominal prices, not the real allocation of resources[1].\nNeutrality of Money: In the classical view, money is neutral in both the long run and (in the absence of frictions) the short run. A change in the money supply leads to an equal proportional change in the price level and other nominal values, leaving real GDP, employment, and real interest rates unaffected[6]. This implies that inflation is fundamentally a monetary phenomenon in the long term. Historical episodes of high inflation underscore this one-to-one link between money growth and prices[36][11].\nCambridge Equation and QTM: The classical theory determines the price level via the Cambridge cash-balance equation \\(M = kPY\\), which is equivalent to the quantity equation \\(MV = PY\\) with \\(V = 1/k\\). This formalizes the Quantity Theory of Money (QTM) – assuming stable velocity (or cash-holding ratio \\(k\\)) and exogenous output, the money supply governs the nominal GDP and price level[15][17]. Excess money supply, given output, bids up prices until money market equilibrium is restored.\nContemporary Relevance: The classical theory provides a crucial baseline for thinking about inflation and monetary policy. It correctly predicts that countries with persistently rapid money growth (relative to output) experience high inflation[37]. Monetarist policies in the 1970s–80s were inspired by this theory and had success in curbing inflation by restraining money growth[21]. Even today, surges in the money supply (e.g. during the COVID-19 crisis) are closely watched for inflationary impact[25].\nLimitations: In practice, the strict classical dichotomy breaks down in the short run. Because of sticky prices, variable velocity, and financial complexities, money is not always neutral in the short-to-medium term. Velocity can shift due to changes in interest rates or public confidence, weakening the link between money and prices[28][32]. Accordingly, modern central banks target inflation via interest rates and other tools rather than fixing the money supply growth alone. The classical theory is best viewed as a long-run anchor – in the long run, excessive money creation will cause inflation – but with the understanding that short-run dynamics can deviate from the classical predictions.",
