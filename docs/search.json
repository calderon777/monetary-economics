    "section": "Questions on Topic 3 - Keynes’s Theory of Money",
    "text": "Questions on Topic 3 - Keynes’s Theory of Money\n\nQuestion 1: Classical vs. Keynesian Views\nCompare and contrast Classical and Keynesian views on the macroeconomic role of money.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndicative Answer to Question 1\n\n\n\n\n\nMain points of similarity:\n\nBoth approaches relate the transaction demand for money positively to nominal GDP.\nBoth can be interpreted using the Cambridge Equation of Exchange as a framework, although the treatment of velocity differs between them.\n\nMain points of difference:\n\nStore of value role: Keynes emphasised the store of value role of money, which is neglected by the Quantity Theory of Money (QTM). The store-of-value role leads to Keynes’ Liquidity Preference theory, which relates money demand negatively to the interest rate. It also underlies the precautionary and speculative motives for money demand that Keynes emphasised.\nInterest rate determination: The different approaches to money demand led to different theories of what determines the interest rate. In Classical theory it is determined by equilibrium in the market for loanable funds, while in Keynesian theory it is determined by equilibrium in the money market. However, these two theories can be reconciled using IS-LM analysis.\nFull employment and neutrality: Classics and Keynes took different positions on the ability of markets to generate full employment equilibrium. The Classical belief in dichotomy of the real from the monetary and the neutrality of money is founded on the assumption of wage and price flexibility in all markets. Keynes disagreed with this in two distinct ways:\n\n(i) The possibility of a liquidity trap in which an excess demand for money could coexist with an excess supply in the goods market for an indefinite period, despite falling price levels.\n(ii) Even outside the liquidity trap, because prices adjusted at different rates in different markets, relative prices would not remain unaffected by price movements; hence the principles of dichotomy and neutrality would not hold.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 2: Exceptional Features of the Money Market\nWhat features of the market for money make it exceptional in terms of how it reacts if there is a shock to the demand for money? Is this a problem for macroeconomic equilibrium? Why or why not?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndicative Answer to Question 2\n\n\n\n\n\nThree exceptional features:\n(a) The price of money is literally one; this is a direct consequence of its role as unit of account. Unlike other markets where disequilibrium results in changes in the nominal price of the item in question, this is not possible in the market for money.\n(b) The supply of money is also unresponsive, as money is exogenously supplied by a sovereign authority (a Central Bank in the modern context).\n(c) There are no close substitutes for money in terms of the liquidity services that it provides (although this is less true today than it was in Keynes’ time).\nIs this a problem?\nThis is not always a problem. Precisely because money is so central in both asset and goods markets, an exogenous increase in the demand for money can lead to collective adjustments in these markets that restore macroeconomic equilibrium.\nAn increase in the demand for money can lead to: - An increase in the interest rate, which induces a shift back from money to interest-bearing assets, and/or - A decrease in the price level, which induces an increase in the demand for goods (collectively) and thus a decrease in the demand for money via Walras’ Law.\nWhen it becomes a problem:\nThese normal adjustment mechanisms fail to work if the economy is caught in a liquidity trap. In such a situation, economic agents are willing to hold unlimited amounts of money due to its perceived security. Thus neither can the interest rate rise in a liquidity trap, nor can falling prices induce a greater demand for goods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 3: The Liquidity Trap\nExplain in words alone (without using diagrams) how the normal adjustment mechanisms that allow equilibrium to be restored following an increase in the demand for money, do not work if the economy is in a liquidity trap.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndicative Answer to Question 3\n\n\n\n\n\nThe liquidity trap is characterised by a situation in which the economy is suffering from low levels of output as well as low interest rates. In such a situation, Keynes argued that economic agents could become unwilling to part with their money (beyond some minimum needed to cover essentials) in exchange either for goods or for other assets. This situation is also known as absolute liquidity preference.\nAt the individual level, absolute liquidity preference can be justified as a result of agents’ uncertainty and pessimism about the future state of the economy. However, when all agents indulge this absolute liquidity preference, the result is precisely the collapse of aggregate demand—and with it economic activity—that agents fear in the first place.\nWhy normal price adjustments fail:\nIn normal times, an increase in the demand for money might temporarily lead to a decrease in the collective demand for goods at the going market price in each goods market. This would trigger competition between goods’ suppliers in each market, leading to a decrease in each good’s price, and therefore of the overall price level. This falling price level would induce greater spending on goods—so long as the economy was not in a liquidity trap (i.e., agents were not exhibiting absolute liquidity preference).\nIn a liquidity trap, however, falling prices do not induce greater spending precisely because the desire to hoard money is unlimited.\nWhy normal interest rate adjustments fail:\nSimilarly, because money is also a store of value that competes with interest-bearing stores of value in agents’ portfolios, an increase in the demand for money would, in normal times, lead to a collective decrease in the demand for interest-bearing assets. Competition amongst the issuers of such assets would result in a higher interest rate, inducing a shift back by savers into holding such assets and eliminating the excess demand for money—so long as the latter is not due to a desire to hoard unlimited amounts of money.\nIn a liquidity trap, however, precisely because the desire to hoard money is unlimited, this mechanism also ceases to work.\n\n\n\n\nReflection after you reveal an indicative answer: - What did you miss? Where was your reasoning thin? - Rewrite one stronger sentence that uses an explicit definition + a clear “because”.\nAbout indicative answers: Indicative answers are explicitly not model answers—they illustrate one acceptable line of reasoning. Your tutorial discussion and your own reasoning remain primary."

    "text": "Questions on Topic 2 - Classical Theory of Money\n\nQuestion 1: Utility Maximization\nConsider a trader who derives utility from two goods, 1 and 2. Her utility function is given by\n\\[U = d_1^{\\alpha} d_2^{1-\\alpha}\\]\nwhere \\(d_1\\) is her demand for good 1 and \\(d_2\\) is her demand for good 2; \\(\\alpha\\) is a parameter that lies between 0 and 1.\nHer initial endowment is \\(s_1 \\geq 0\\) units of good 1 and \\(s_2 \\geq 0\\) units of good 2.\n(a) Suppose that the nominal price of good 1 is \\(P_1\\) and that of good 2 is \\(P_2\\). Write an expression for her nominal “income” \\(y_N\\).\n(b) Write her budget constraint as a function of the price of each good, her demand of each good and her nominal income \\(y_N\\).\n(c) She maximises her utility function subject to the budget constraint. Write down her utility maximisation problem and derive the first-order conditions.\n(d) Solve for her demands of each good \\(d_1\\), \\(d_2\\) as functions of \\(P_1\\), \\(P_2\\) and \\(y_N\\).\n(e) Now express her demands \\(d_1\\), \\(d_2\\) as functions of \\(P_1\\), \\(P_2\\), \\(s_1\\) and \\(s_2\\). What happens to her demands if all prices double?\n(f) Suppose \\(s_1 = 2\\), \\(s_2 = 10\\), \\(P_1 = 2\\), \\(P_2 = 1\\), and \\(\\alpha = 0.5\\). What will be her net purchase of each good. Note: A net purchase is the difference between the amount she demands of each good and the amount she had in her endowment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndicative Answer to Question 1\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Nominal income: \\[y_N = P_1 s_1 + P_2 s_2\\]\n(b) Budget constraint: \\[P_1 d_1 + P_2 d_2 = y_N\\]\n(c) Utility maximisation problem: \\[\\mathcal{L} = d_1^{\\alpha} d_2^{1-\\alpha} + \\lambda[y_N - P_1 d_1 - P_2 d_2]\\]\nFirst-order conditions: \\[\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial d_1} = \\alpha \\left(\\frac{d_2}{d_1}\\right)^{1-\\alpha} - \\lambda P_1 = 0\\] \\[\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial d_2} = (1-\\alpha) \\left(\\frac{d_1}{d_2}\\right)^{\\alpha} - \\lambda P_2 = 0\\] \\[\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\lambda} = y_N - P_1 d_1 - P_2 d_2 = 0\\]\n(d) Combining FOCs for \\(d_1\\) and \\(d_2\\): \\[\\lambda = \\frac{\\alpha}{P_1}\\left(\\frac{d_2}{d_1}\\right)^{1-\\alpha} = \\frac{(1-\\alpha)}{P_2}\\left(\\frac{d_1}{d_2}\\right)^{\\alpha}\\]\nRearranging: \\[\\frac{d_2}{d_1} = \\frac{(1-\\alpha)}{\\alpha} \\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\] \\[d_2 = \\left[\\frac{(1-\\alpha)}{\\alpha} \\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right] d_1\\]\nPlugging into the budget constraint: \\[P_1 d_1 + P_2 \\left[\\frac{(1-\\alpha)}{\\alpha} \\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right] d_1 = y_N\\] \\[P_1 d_1 \\left[1 + \\frac{1-\\alpha}{\\alpha}\\right] = y_N\\] \\[P_1 d_1 \\left[\\frac{\\alpha + 1 - \\alpha}{\\alpha}\\right] = y_N\\]\nTherefore: \\[d_1^* = \\alpha \\frac{y_N}{P_1}\\] \\[d_2^* = (1-\\alpha) \\frac{y_N}{P_2}\\]\nThese represent optimal choices of \\(d_1\\), \\(d_2\\).\n(e) Expanding \\(y_N\\): \\[d_1^* = \\alpha \\left[\\frac{P_1 s_1 + P_2 s_2}{P_1}\\right] = \\alpha\\left[s_1 + \\frac{P_2}{P_1}s_2\\right]\\] \\[d_2^* = (1-\\alpha)\\left[\\frac{P_1 s_1 + P_2 s_2}{P_2}\\right] = (1-\\alpha)\\left[\\frac{P_1}{P_2}s_1 + s_2\\right]\\]\nIf \\(P_1\\), \\(P_2\\) double, \\(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\) and \\(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\) are unaffected.\nSo \\(d_1^*\\), \\(d_2^*\\) unchanged, reflecting the homogeneity of demand functions.\n(f) Plugging in \\(s_1 = 2\\), \\(s_2 = 10\\), \\(P_1 = 2\\), \\(P_2 = 1\\), \\(\\alpha = 0.5\\): \\[d_1^* = 0.5\\left[2 + \\frac{1}{2}(10)\\right] = 0.5[2 + 5] = 3.5\\] \\[d_2^* = 0.5\\left[\\frac{2}{1}(2) + 10\\right] = 0.5[4 + 10] = 7\\]\nNet purchase: \\[d_1^* - s_1 = 3.5 - 2 = 1.5 \\text{ (net purchase of good 1)}\\] \\[d_2^* - s_2 = 7 - 10 = -3 \\text{ (net sale of good 2)}\\]\nNote that net purchase of 1 = net sale of 2 in value terms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 2: General Equilibrium in an Exchange Economy\nConsider an exchange economy with 2 traders, \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) and 2 goods, 1 and 2. The nominal price of each good is \\(P_1\\) and \\(P_2\\) respectively.\nSuppose that each trader has the following endowment of each good:\n\\[s^A = (s_1^A, s_2^A)\\] \\[s^B = (s_1^B, s_2^B)\\]\nwhere \\(s_j^i \\geq 0\\) for \\(i = A, B\\) and \\(j = 1, 2\\).\nLet \\(d_1^A\\), \\(d_2^A\\) represent agent \\(A\\)’s demand for each of the two goods and \\(d_1^B\\), \\(d_2^B\\) likewise for agent \\(B\\). Suppose that each agent’s endowment is exogenous but her demand for each good is a function of its relative price.\n(a) Write down each agent’s budget constraint in (i) nominal terms and (ii) in real terms, using good 1 as a numeraire (i.e. unit of account).\n(b) Write down the market clearing condition for each good (Note: The demand for each good by each agent will be expressed as a function of the relative price of \\(P_2/P_1\\) and her real income evaluated in equivalent units of good 1).\n(c) Show that when: (i) each agent’s budget constraint is binding (i.e. their total spending exactly equals their real income) (ii) the market for good 1 is in equilibrium, then the market for good 2 is also bound to be in equilibrium. What ‘law’ have you illustrated?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndicative Answer to Question 2\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Budget constraints:\nNominal budget constraints:\nAgent A: \\(P_1 d_1^{A*} + P_2 d_2^{A*} \\leq P_1 s_1^A + P_2 s_2^A\\)\nAgent B: \\(P_1 d_1^{B*} + P_2 d_2^{B*} \\leq P_1 s_1^B + P_2 s_2^B\\)\nReal terms (using good 1 as numeraire):\nAgent A: \\(d_1^{A*} + \\frac{P_2}{P_1} d_2^{A*} \\leq s_1^A + \\frac{P_2}{P_1} s_2^A\\)\nAgent B: \\(d_1^{B*} + \\frac{P_2}{P_1} d_2^{B*} \\leq s_1^B + \\frac{P_2}{P_1} s_2^B\\)\nwhere demands are functions of relative price and real income: \\[d_1^{A*} = d_1^A\\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}, \\frac{y_N^A}{P_1}\\right), \\quad d_2^{A*} = d_2^A\\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}, \\frac{y_N^A}{P_1}\\right)\\] \\[d_1^{B*} = d_1^B\\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}, \\frac{y_N^B}{P_1}\\right), \\quad d_2^{B*} = d_2^B\\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}, \\frac{y_N^B}{P_1}\\right)\\]\n(b) Market clearing conditions (total purchases = total sales):\nGood 1: \\(d_1^{A*} + d_1^{B*} = s_1^A + s_1^B \\Rightarrow D_1 = S_1\\)\nGood 2: \\(d_2^{A*} + d_2^{B*} = s_2^A + s_2^B \\Rightarrow D_2 = S_2\\)\n(c) Suppose \\(D_1 = S_1\\), assume that the budget constraint of each agent holds as “=” (binding), then only the real ones need to be looked at:\n\\[d_1^{A*} + \\frac{P_2}{P_1} d_2^{A*} + d_1^{B*} + \\frac{P_2}{P_1} d_2^{B*} = s_1^A + \\frac{P_2}{P_1}s_2^A + s_1^B + \\frac{P_2}{P_1}s_2^B\\]\nRearranging: \\[\\underbrace{(d_1^{A*} + d_1^{B*})}_{A} + \\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\underbrace{(d_2^{A*} + d_2^{B*})}_{B} = \\underbrace{(s_1^A + s_1^B)}_{A} + \\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\underbrace{(s_2^A + s_2^B)}_{B}\\]\nSince \\(D_1 = S_1\\) (market for good 1 clears), terms A cancel: \\[\\frac{P_2}{P_1}(d_2^{A*} + d_2^{B*}) = \\frac{P_2}{P_1}(s_2^A + s_2^B)\\] \\[\\therefore D_2 = S_2\\]\nThis establishes Walras’ Law: If \\(n-1\\) markets clear and all budget constraints bind, the \\(n\\)-th market must also clear.\n\n\n\n\nReflection after you reveal an indicative answer: - What did you miss? Where was your reasoning thin? - Rewrite one stronger sentence that uses an explicit definition + a clear “because”.\nAbout indicative answers: Indicative answers will be released after your tutorial.

    "section": "During the Tutorial",
    "text": "During the Tutorial\n\nCore Tutor Moves\n\n1. Diagnose Misconceptions\nListen for gaps in causal reasoning or false equivalences.\nRed flags: - “Money does all three functions because it’s money” (circular reasoning). - “All three roles always happen together” (overgeneralization). - Attributes listed but not causally connected to outcomes.\nDiagnostic questions: - “Walk me through: why does accepting money now (MoE) mean you’ll store value?” - “If I defined prices in SDR but paid in USD, would SDR be a medium of exchange? Why not?” - “What must be true about an object for it to serve as MoE? Which of those also apply to UoA?”\n\n\n2. Judge Quality of Reasoning\nDistinguish between correct labels and solid reasoning.\nGood indicators: - Student can identify the constraint or mechanism (time gap, information requirements, coordination costs). - Student qualifies claims: “MoE and SoV are linked when there’s a time gap.” - Student distinguishes necessity from sufficiency: “Durability is necessary for MoE but not sufficient.”\nWeak indicators: - Lists attributes without explaining why they matter. - Uses examples but doesn’t abstract the principle. - Asserts conclusions without deriving them from the problem.\n\n\n3. Reframe Using Student Language\nTake their partial reasoning and sharpen it.\nStudent says: “Money is hard to break so it’s liquid.”\nYou reframe: “You’re noticing divisibility. Can you connect that back to the question? If I can’t divide it, what happens to my ability to make transactions?”\nStudent says: “MoE is easier than barter because everyone accepts money.”\nYou reframe: “Right—because it’s universally accepted, I don’t need to find someone who both has what I want and wants what I have. But does that same universal acceptance matter for UoA? If I’m just pricing apples in euros, do apples need to accept euros?”\n\n\n4. Signal Assessment Relevance\nExplicitly link discussion to exam skills.\n\n“Examiners test whether you can defend a claim, not just state it. How would you defend ‘UoA is independent’ if an examiner pushed back?”\n“In exams, you’ll lose marks for overgeneralizing. Notice how we keep qualifying: ‘in modern economies,’ ‘with commodity money,’ etc.”\n“Examiners reward clear causal logic. A marking rubric would ask: ‘Did the student explain why, not just what?’”"

    "section": "Key Questions by Topic",
    "text": "Key Questions by Topic\n\nQuestion 1: MoE → SoV → UoA\nGoal: Students see that SoV logically follows from MoE (time gap), but UoA is independent.\nChallenge questions:\n\nOn the SoV link:\n\n“Why is there necessarily a time gap between selling and buying?”\n“Could I use MoE without storing value? What would that look like?”\n“Does every use of MoE involve storing value, or just some uses?”\n\nOn UoA independence:\n\n“Why is UoA not automatic from MoE? What’s the logical gap?”\n“Could prices exist without money? How?”\n“If I price things in euros but transact in gold, what’s happening?”\n\nOn real examples:\n\n“Is SDR a good example of UoA without MoE? What makes it work?”\n“Why doesn’t everyone just use euros for UoA and MoE? Is there ever a reason to separate them?”\n\n\nAssessment link: “Exams often ask: ‘Explain why X follows logically but Y does not.’ This question tests that distinction. You need to show the logical chain, not just assume functions cluster together.”\n\n\n\nQuestion 2: Liquidity Characteristics & Physical Attributes\nGoal: Students link liquidity (economic outcome) to physical attributes (enabling constraints).\nChallenge questions:\n\nOn causal direction:\n\n“Start with why divisibility matters. If I can’t split it, what happens?”\n“Now reverse: if something is infinitely divisible but nobody wants it, is it liquid?”\n“So what’s the relationship: do physical attributes cause liquidity, or just enable it?”\n\nOn conflation:\n\n“Is ‘durability’ a liquidity characteristic or a physical requirement for durability?”\n“Can something be durable but not liquid? (e.g., a house).”\n“What do we mean by ‘durability’ in the context of MoE—physical durability or value durability?”\n\nOn universality:\n\n“Does every object need all four characteristics to be liquid, or just some?”\n“Can something be highly marketable (Q4) but fail on transportability?”\n\n\nAssessment link: “In exams, you’ll encounter questions like: ‘Why can’t X serve as money?’ The answer isn’t ‘because it fails on X attribute’—it’s ‘because when people try to use it as MoE, they encounter problem Y, which breaks attribute Z.’ Show the chain.”\n\n\n\nQuestion 3: Three-Trader Alternatives to MoE\nGoal: Students derive the necessity of MoE by working through why alternatives fail.\nChallenge questions:\n\nOn the middleman approach:\n\n“How does the middleman solve the three-trader problem? Walk me through the trades.”\n“What information does the middleman need? Who gives it to them?”\n“In a real market with 1000 goods and 10,000 traders, is the middleman approach scalable?”\n\nOn multilateral trades:\n\n“Why does simultaneous exchange work for three people?”\n“Now imagine 100 traders and 50 goods. How long does coordination take?”\n“What’s the cost of failed coordination? (Someone shows up but the deal falls through.)”\n\nOn MoE as solution:\n\n“What problem does MoE solve that these alternatives struggle with?”\n“Is MoE the only solution, or just an efficient one?”\n“In a world of perfect information and zero coordination costs, would we need MoE?”\n\n\nAssessment link: “Exam questions often ask you to justify why a system exists (MoE, central banking, fiat money, etc.). The logic is: what problem does it solve? Show the problem first, then show how the solution addresses it.”"

    "section": "Tutor Commentary: Common Observations",
    "text": "Tutor Commentary: Common Observations\nUse this section to frame feedback and calibrate expectations with students.\n\nCommon Misconceptions Observed\nQuestion 1 (MoE → SoV → UoA): - Students often conflate “automatic” with “necessary”. SoV follows from MoE in practice (time gap), but students sometimes suggest all three roles are equally entangled. - UoA independence is frequently overlooked; students default to assuming MoE is always UoA.\nQuestion 2 (Liquidity characteristics): - Students list the four attributes but struggle to connect them causally. They state “marketability matters” without explaining why it generates liquidity. - Physical attributes are sometimes confused with economic attributes; e.g., “gold is valuable” vs. “gold is transportable and durable, which enables it to be valuable as MoE.”\nQuestion 3 (Three-trader alternatives): - Students often propose clearinghouse as a general solution without acknowledging search costs or information requirements. - The conclusion about MoE simplifying coordination is stated but not derived from the example’s complexity.\n\n\nGood Reasoning Patterns to Highlight\n\nExplicit causal chains: “Because there is a time gap between sale and purchase, money must store value.”\nContrasts between concepts: “Unlike MoE, which requires universal acceptance, UoA only requires shared definition.”\nLinks to real examples with reasoning: “SDR shows UoA can exist without MoE because it’s used for accounting, not transactions.”\n\n\n\nLinks to Exam Expectations\n\nExam-style framing: Questions will test whether you can defend a position using economic logic, not just list definitions.\nMarking focus: Marks are awarded for reasoning (causal links, scope limitations) more than for correct labels.\nCommon traps: Overgeneralizing from one context (e.g., “all money serves all three roles everywhere”) without qualification.\n\n\n\nReleasing Indicative Answers\nFrame explicitly: &gt; “Here are indicative answers—not model answers. They show one acceptable reasoning path. Your tutorial discussion and your own refined thinking remain primary. Use these to check your causal logic, not to replace your own reasoning.”\n\n\nCompare Approaches\n\n“Notice how the indicative answer on Q1 carefully distinguishes necessity from sufficiency. Do the same in exams.”\n“Notice how the indicative answer on Q2 starts with mechanism (why marketability matters) before listing attributes.”\n“Notice how the indicative answer on Q3 derives the MoE conclusion from the failure of alternatives, not by assumption.”\n\n\n\nNext Steps\n\nEncourage students to rewrite their answers after the tutorial, incorporating feedback.\nAssign a comparison task: “Write a paragraph on Q2 that contrasts two liquidity characteristics and explains why both matter.”\nLink forward: “Question 3 logic applies next week when we discuss why fiat money works. Same reasoning pattern.”"

    "text": "title: “Monetary Economics” subtitle: “Classical Theory of Money” author: “Dr Camilo Calderon” draft: true format: html: toc: true toc-depth: 3 number-sections: true code-fold: true pdf: toc: true number-sections: true execute: echo: false\n\nClassical Theory of Money\nIntroduction The classical theory of money is an approach in macroeconomics asserting that money primarily influences nominal variables (prices, wages) and has negligible effect on real economic activity (output, employment) in the long run. Classical economists often say “money is a veil”, meaning that the system of money prices may obscure real economic relationships, but in reality the underlying real economy is unchanged by the quantity of money in circulation[1]. This theory, rooted in the 19th-century Walrasian general equilibrium framework and the early 20th-century Quantity Theory of Money, underpins the view that sustained changes in the money supply lead to proportional changes in the price level, with real variables determined by real factors like technology and preferences. In this reading, we outline the classical model of a monetary economy and its key implications – the Walrasian system of general equilibrium, the classical dichotomy between real and monetary sectors, the neutrality of money, the Cambridge equation of exchange, and the Quantity Theory of Money (QTM) – and discuss how these ideas hold up with contemporary examples. We also examine the limitations of the classical view, including situations (such as short-run economic fluctuations or extreme policy environments) where money may not be neutral and why modern economists and central banks have nuanced this theory. The Walrasian System of General Equilibrium (Real Economy) Classical theory builds on the Walrasian general equilibrium model of a barter economy (named after Léon Walras, 1834–1910, a pioneer of mathematical economics). In a Walrasian system, all markets for goods and services simultaneously clear through price adjustment. Formally, it consists of a set of market-clearing conditions (one for each good or factor) and a corresponding set of relative prices that adjust to equate supply and demand in every market[2]. Importantly, only relative prices matter in this system – prices are expressed in terms of one another (for instance, how many units of good A trade for one unit of good B). One good can be chosen as a numéraire (unit of account) to price all other goods, fixing the scale for relative prices. Because all prices in Walrasian equilibrium are determined only up to a common scale, the model exhibits homogeneity: if all prices were doubled (or halved), the real allocations of goods would remain the same. This implies that in a purely real economy without money, the absolute price level is indeterminate – there is no unique solution for “the” price level, only for relative prices. In other words, the Walrasian model determines what and how much gets produced and consumed (real output and relative price ratios), but not the overall monetary value of those goods. Walras’ Law holds that if all but one markets are in equilibrium, the last market must also clear (excess supply in one market must be matched by excess demand in at least one other), ensuring consistency of the general equilibrium[3][4]. In this frictionless, barter-style economy, real variables – such as real output, the allocation of goods, and relative prices – are determined entirely by real factors (preferences, endowments, technology) without any reference to the money supply. This is the foundation of the classical idea that money is nonessential in determining real economic outcomes. However, to analyze an economy with money (a monetary economy), we need to introduce money into the Walrasian system in a way that pins down the general price level. The Classical Dichotomy: Real vs Monetary Sides of the Economy The introduction of money into the model leads to what is known as the classical dichotomy – a strict separation between the determination of real variables and nominal variables. According to the classical dichotomy, real variables (such as real GDP, real consumption, employment, and relative prices of goods) are determined independently of nominal variables (such as the absolute price level, inflation rate, and nominal money supply)[5]. In practical terms, one can first solve for the real equilibrium of the economy (the allocation of resources and relative prices as if it were a barter economy), and then determine the nominal price level by considering the money market. The presence of money serves only to convert the barter terms of trade into monetary terms; it does not alter the underlying real equilibrium. This dichotomy reflects the notion that money is neutral in its effect on the real economy, an idea we explore more below. In the classical view, money’s sole function in general equilibrium is to determine the units in which prices are quoted – essentially acting as a unit of account and medium of exchange without changing real outcomes. Walras’s model extended to include money treats money as an additional “good” for which supply and demand must equilibrate, but crucially, changes in the supply of money do not affect the equilibrium quantities of other goods or relative prices (they only affect absolute nominal prices). The system of equations describing the economy can thus be partitioned into a real subsystem and a monetary subsystem, with minimal feedback from the monetary side to the real side – this is the essence of the classical dichotomy[5]. Historically, classical economists like David Hume illustrated the dichotomy with thought experiments: if overnight every person’s stock of money doubled, people would initially feel wealthier and try to spend more, but with no change in the real quantity of goods, prices would soon double as well. Ultimately, the economy would be in the same real state as before, just with all prices (and monetary values) scaled up. The real output, employment, and relative prices would be unchanged – only the monetary values differ. This parable encapsulates the classical dichotomy by showing that real wealth hasn’t changed even though nominal money holdings did. Neutrality of Money in the Classical Model From the classical dichotomy stems the principle of the neutrality of money. Money is said to be neutral if changes in the stock of money have no effect on real economic variables (like real output or the real interest rate), affecting only nominal variables (like the price level or nominal incomes). In the classical theory, with flexible prices and wages, money is neutral even in the short run. A change in the money supply – whether through gold discoveries in a classical gold standard economy or open-market operations by a central bank – will proportionally change all money prices but leave real production and consumption decisions unaltered[6]. Long-run monetary neutrality is a core implication: for example, a permanent doubling of the money supply is predicted to eventually lead to a doubling of the price level (a 100% inflation), with real GDP, employment, and real interest rates returning to their original levels[7]. In classical thought, this adjustment happens relatively quickly as prices are fully flexible. All agents understand that only nominal values have changed, so there is no lasting effect on output or other real magnitudes. How does this adjustment occur? We can think in terms of supply and demand for money. Suppose the economy’s real output \\(Y\\) and money demand behavior are initially given, and the central bank unexpectedly doubles the money supply (\\(M\\)). At the old price level \\(P_0\\), there is now excess supply of money – people have more money than they desire to hold relative to goods. They will try to get rid of the excess money balances by increasing spending on goods and services (or purchasing assets). This creates an excess demand for goods (equivalently, an excess demand for all non-money assets) by Walras’ Law[8]. With more money chasing the same amount of goods, prices begin to rise. Higher prices reduce the real purchasing power of the excess money, thereby reducing the excess money balances. The price level will continue to rise until the real value of the money supply \\(M/P\\) has increased enough that people are willing to hold the entire new money supply. At the new equilibrium, the price level \\(P_1\\) will be higher (in fact, roughly double \\(P_0\\) in this scenario), such that the ratio \\(M/P\\) is restored to the original real money demand. Real variables (the quantity of goods produced and consumed) remain the same, but all nominal prices have doubled. Essentially, the equilibrium shifts from \\((M_0, P_0)\\) to \\((M_1, P_1)\\), with \\(M_1 = 2 M_0\\) and \\(P_1 \\approx 2 P_0\\), so that the real money supply \\(M_1/P_1\\) equals the original \\(M_0/P_0\\). To visualize money neutrality, consider a simple money market diagram (value of money on the vertical axis and quantity of money on the horizontal axis). The demand for money is downward sloping in terms of the value of money (i.e. \\(1/P\\)) – at higher price levels (lower \\(1/P\\)), people need to hold more nominal money for transactions, so the demand for nominal balances increases as \\(1/P\\) falls. The supply of money is fixed exogenously by the central bank (a vertical line at the given \\(M\\)). Equilibrium occurs where money supply equals money demand, determining the equilibrium \\(1/P\\). Now, if the money supply increases (the vertical line shifts to the right), the intersection with the demand curve moves downward – the equilibrium value of money \\(1/P\\) falls, which means the price level \\(P\\) rises in proportion to the increase in \\(M\\). The following figure illustrates this outcome:\nIllustration: Equilibrium in the money market determines the value of money (the inverse of the price level). The demand for money (\\(D_M\\)) is downward sloping in terms of \\(1/P\\), and the money supply (\\(S_M\\)) is vertical (fixed by policy). An increase in the money supply from \\(M_0\\) to \\(M_1\\) shifts the supply curve rightward, causing the equilibrium value of money to drop from \\(1/P_0\\) to \\(1/P_1\\) – equivalently, the price level \\(P\\) rises. In classical theory, real output (\\(Y\\)) and money demand parameters are unchanged, so this change in \\(P\\) leaves real variables unaffected.[9] In the classical long-run perspective, empirical evidence does show that countries with persistently higher money growth tend to have higher inflation, consistent with money neutrality in the long term. Cross-country studies find a close one-to-one relationship between the rate of money growth (in excess of real GDP growth) and the inflation rate in the long run[10]. For example, during episodes of hyperinflation, excessive money creation clearly leads to soaring prices: Zimbabwe’s central bank, by printing money in the 2000s, contributed to one of the worst hyperinflations on record – at its peak in 2008, prices in Zimbabwe were estimated to be rising at an astronomical rate of 500 billion percent per year[11]. Such extreme cases demonstrate that pouring huge amounts of money into an economy with limited output will drastically reduce money’s value (raise the price level). In more moderate circumstances too, “if the money supply grows too big relative to the size of an economy, the unit value of the currency diminishes – its purchasing power falls and prices rise”[12], which is precisely the quantity theory prediction. It should be noted, however, that classical theory abstracts from short-run frictions. In reality, prices and wages may not adjust immediately (they can be sticky in the short run), so a sudden increase in the money supply might temporarily boost real activity – a possibility acknowledged even by later monetarist economists[13]. The classical model, though, assumes away these short-run rigidities, focusing on the ultimate outcome after prices have fully adjusted. In that full-adjustment scenario, money is neutral: aside from the price level and other nominal values, nothing real has changed. The Cambridge Equation of Exchange (Cash-Balance Approach) To determine the price level in a monetary economy, classical economists augmented the Walrasian real system with an equation describing money demand – famously formulated by the Cambridge school of economists (Alfred Marshall, A.C. Pigou, and even a young John Maynard Keynes) in the early 1900s. The Cambridge equation (or cash-balance equation) focuses on the demand for money as a proportion of income. It can be expressed as: M^d=k P Y, where \\(M^d\\) is the desired nominal money holdings (money demand), \\(P\\) is the general price level, \\(Y\\) is real national income (real output), and \\(k\\) is a parameter representing the fraction of nominal income that people wish to hold in the form of money (their cash holding ratio). In equilibrium, we assume the money market clears, so the supply of money \\(M\\) equals money demand \\(M^d\\). Thus, the Cambridge equilibrium condition is: M=k P Y. This simple equation embodies the idea that people plan to hold a certain proportion \\(k\\) of their income in cash balances for convenience and safety. The value of \\(k\\) reflects factors like payment habits, financial technology, and preferences for liquidity – for example, if people keep one month’s worth of income as cash on average, \\(k\\) might be about \\(1/12 \\approx 0.08\\). The velocity of money \\(V\\) is the inverse of this cash-balance ratio: V=1/k. Velocity \\(V\\) measures how many times per period the average unit of currency is spent on final goods and services (i.e. how quickly money circulates). If \\(k=0.1\\), then \\(V=10\\), meaning each dollar (or pound, etc.) is used to purchase 10 dollars’ worth of output per period on average. The Cambridge equation can be rewritten to make the price level the subject: P=M/(k Y). This tells us that for a given real output \\(Y\\) and given money demand parameter \\(k\\), the price level \\(P\\) adjusts in proportion to the money supply \\(M\\). In other words, the quantity of money in circulation relative to the economy’s output (adjusted by how much money people want to hold) determines the price level. If the money supply doubles, then unless there is a change in \\(Y\\) or \\(k\\), the price level must double to maintain the equality \\(M = k P Y\\). In the classical model, \\(Y\\) is determined by real factors (and in the long run by things like technology and resources), and \\(k\\) is assumed to be stable (or exogenously given by institutions and preferences). Therefore, any change in \\(M\\) translates to an proportional change in \\(P\\). This Cambridge equation thus fills the gap in the Walrasian system: whereas the Walrasian real equilibrium couldn’t pin down the absolute level of prices, adding the money market equilibrium condition (\\(M\\) supply equals \\(M^d = kPY\\) demand) yields a solution for the nominal price level[14]. The classical dichotomy is evident here – the real variable \\(Y\\) is solved elsewhere, and once \\(Y\\) is known, the nominal variable \\(P\\) adjusts to satisfy the money equation given \\(M\\). It’s worth noting that the Cambridge cash-balance approach is just a different perspective on the quantity theory of money, emphasizing money demand instead of supply. Unlike the “transactions” version of the quantity theory (associated with American economist Irving Fisher, discussed next), which treats velocity as given and focuses on the flow of money spending, the Cambridge equation arises from thinking about how much of their income people wish to hold in monetary form at any time. Both approaches, however, arrive at a similar conclusion: a linkage between the money supply and nominal income. Indeed, if we take the Cambridge equation and multiply both sides by \\(V = 1/k\\), we get \\(M \\cdot V = P \\cdot Y\\). Thus the Cambridge equation is mathematically equivalent to the more famous equation of exchange, as long as we identify \\(V = 1/k\\)[15]. The two formulations differ subtly in interpretation – the classical (Fisherian) view tends to treat \\(V\\) as a constant technical parameter and money as only a medium of exchange, whereas the Cambridge view gives \\(k\\) (hence \\(V\\)) a behavioral interpretation and recognizes money’s role as a store of value that people may desire to hold. But in the strict classical theory, \\(k\\) (and hence \\(V\\)) was taken to be fairly stable in the short run, so the distinction did not undermine the overall prediction. The Quantity Theory of Money (QTM) The Quantity Theory of Money is the centerpiece of classical monetary theory. It is often summarized by the equation of exchange: M×V=P×Y. Here \\(M\\) is the money supply, \\(V\\) is the velocity of money, \\(P\\) is the price level, and \\(Y\\) is real output (often \\(Y\\) is taken to be real GDP for the whole economy). This equation is an identity – it defines velocity \\(V\\) as the ratio of nominal GDP (\\(P \\times Y\\)) to the money stock \\(M\\). It says that the total amount of money multiplied by the number of times each unit of money is used to buy goods (velocity) equals the total monetary value of goods purchased (\\(P \\times Y\\)) in the economy. As an accounting statement, this always holds true by construction in any given period. The equation of exchange becomes a powerful theory (the QTM) with one key additional assumption: velocity \\(V\\) is constant (or at least predictable), and independent of other variables, and real output \\(Y\\) is determined by non-monetary factors (e.g. resources and technology, as in the Walrasian real system). Under these assumptions, any change in \\(M\\) must be reflected primarily in \\(P\\). In growth rate form, the quantity theory predicts that the inflation rate (growth of \\(P\\)) will equal the growth rate of money minus the growth rate of real output (since \\(V\\) is constant)[16]. For example, if the money supply grows 5% per year and real GDP grows 2% per year, QTM would predict roughly 3% annual inflation in the long run (5% – 2% = 3%). In short, the Quantity Theory of Money posits a direct, proportional relationship between the money supply and the price level, when other factors are held constant[17]. It is “one of the oldest hypotheses in economics,” linking excessive money growth to inflation[18][19]. A classical quantity theorist typically assumes that \\(V\\) is stable due to institutions or habits (for instance, people might get paid monthly and pay bills monthly, implying a regular turnover of money). Empirically, velocity does change over time, but in early 20th century economies it was often sufficiently stable in the short run that treating it as roughly constant was not a bad approximation[20]. Meanwhile, \\(Y\\) in the long run is determined by labor, capital, technology, etc., not by the money supply. Therefore, increases in \\(M\\) lead to proportionate increases in \\(P\\). This formalizes the intuition behind money neutrality. As an IMF explainer succinctly put it, “if the money supply grows too big relative to the size of an economy, the unit value of the currency diminishes – its purchasing power falls and prices rise”[12]. The Quantity Theory thus provides a mechanism for how inflation can be controlled by controlling money growth. It underlies the famous maxim by Milton Friedman (a leading 20th-century monetarist) that “inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.” Historical example: The QTM was vividly demonstrated during the Great Inflation of the 1970s. In the United States and United Kingdom, rapid growth of the money supply was accompanied by surging prices. Monetarist economists, reviving the classical QTM, argued that to bring down inflation, central banks needed to restrain money growth. Indeed, in 1979 the U.S. Federal Reserve under Paul Volcker dramatically changed policy to target the money supply growth rate. By limiting money growth, the Fed was able to squeeze inflation out of the system by the early 1980s, albeit at the cost of a recession[21]. Similarly, the U.K. adopted monetarist policies under Margaret Thatcher. These policy episodes were inspired directly by QTM logic – essentially applying classical theory to practice – and they lend support to the long-run link between money and prices. Many countries thereafter maintained a focus on low money growth to keep inflation low (until the practice of inflation targeting eventually replaced direct money targets, as discussed later). Another dramatic example is the relationship between money growth and hyperinflation. We mentioned Zimbabwe’s hyperinflation; similarly, classic case studies like the Weimar German hyperinflation of 1923 show a clear QTM pattern. In Weimar Germany, the government massively increased the paper money supply to finance expenses, and the price level exploded in proportion, to the point where money became nearly worthless. Such episodes reinforce that, when taken to extremes, money growth and inflation go hand-in-hand. It’s important to realize that the Quantity Theory of Money (QTM), as used in classical theory, is more than just the identity \\(MV=PY\\). It is the hypothesis that causality runs from left to right: the money supply is exogenous (determined by the central bank or gold supply) and is the primary driver of nominal GDP and the price level in the long run, with velocity and real GDP growth taken as given. The QTM assumes long-run neutrality (money only affects \\(P\\)) and often also assumes dichotomy (that real output \\(Y\\) is determined independently). Under these conditions, controlling inflation is as simple as controlling money supply growth. Monetarist economists in the 20th century extended this classical theory, asserting that a stable money growth rule would lead to stable prices[22][23]. They pointed to statistical correlations between money and prices, and argued, for example, that the Great Depression of the 1930s in the U.S. was largely due to a sharp contraction of the money stock (a thesis advanced by Friedman and Schwartz in A Monetary History of the United States[24]). The QTM has seen a resurgence in debate in recent years. After the Global Financial Crisis of 2007–09, central banks injected unprecedented amounts of money into economies (through quantitative easing), yet inflation in many advanced economies remained subdued for a long time in the 2010s. This led some to question whether the classical quantity relation had broken down, as velocity appeared to decline. However, following the COVID-19 pandemic, money growth spiked again (for example, U.S. M2 money supply grew over 25% year-on-year at one point in 2020), and by 2021–2022 inflation jumped to multi-decade highs. Analysts noted that a simple quantity-theoretic linkage between money and inflation seemed to reassert itself during this period[25]. In fact, a basic model using money growth did successfully signal the rise of inflation post-2020, even though it had failed to predict inflation in the prior two decades of low inflation[26][16]. This mixed record underscores that the QTM holds well under some circumstances (especially when there are large swings in money growth and when the economy is near full capacity), but can be less reliable in others – a point we now examine as we discuss the limitations of the classical view. Limitations of the Classical View While the classical theory of money provides a useful benchmark and is largely borne out in the long run, economists have long identified several limitations and caveats to its applicability. In practice, the strict classical dichotomy and money neutrality do not always hold, especially in the short run or under certain conditions. Here are some key limitations and challenges to the classical view: Short-Run Non-Neutrality and Price Stickiness: The classical model assumes fully flexible prices and wages that instantaneously clear markets. In reality, many prices (e.g. wages in contracts, or prices set by firms) adjust slowly. In the presence of such sticky prices, changes in the money supply can have short-term real effects. This was a central insight of John Maynard Keynes and later Keynesian economics: if the money supply increases, in the short run it may lower interest rates and stimulate investment and consumption, thus increasing real output and employment – contrary to neutrality. Only over time, as prices gradually adjust, will the full effect be reflected in the price level. Keynesians argue that during recessions or periods of slack, output is demand-determined, and an increase in money (and thus demand) can raise output rather than prices. The classical dichotomy is thus violated in the short run: real and nominal variables are intertwined. Modern empirical research confirms that money is not neutral in the short term – for instance, expansionary monetary policy often boosts real GDP for a couple of years before inflation catches up. Even monetarist economists accept the idea of short-run monetary nonneutrality due to lags in price adjustment[13]. The long-run neutrality may still hold, but the journey matters for economic fluctuations. Unstable Velocity and Money Demand: The classical QTM assumes velocity (\\(V\\)) or the Cambridge \\(k\\) is fixed (or at least exogenous and stable). In reality, velocity can and does change due to various factors – interest rates, financial innovation, payment technologies, and economic uncertainty can all affect how much money people want to hold relative to income. Keynes, in his critique of the classical theory, introduced the idea of speculative demand for money (part of his liquidity preference theory), suggesting that \\(k\\) is not a constant but depends on the interest rate: when interest rates are low, people are less incentivized to hold bonds and more content holding money, so money demand rises (velocity falls), and vice versa. He also noted that expectations of deflation or financial turmoil can make people hoard cash (increasing \\(k\\) dramatically). In symbolic form, Keynesians might express money demand as \\(M^d = k(i) \\, P \\, Y\\), where \\(k\\) is a function of the nominal interest rate \\(i\\) (and perhaps other variables like expectations of inflation)[27]. This view implies that velocity is endogenous and can vary widely – which undermines the simple classical QTM prediction. Indeed, Keynesians attach little or no significance to a rigid quantity theory rule precisely because velocity is inherently unstable[28]. Empirical history vindicates this concern: for example, in the 1980s, financial deregulation and innovation in banking altered the stability of money demand in the US and UK, causing velocity of traditional aggregates (like \\(M1\\) or \\(M2\\)) to shift unpredictably. During the 1990s and 2000s, the rise of credit cards, money market funds, and later digital payment platforms continued to change money holding patterns. Central banks found that targeting a money supply growth rate (as suggested by monetarism) became unreliable because the relationship between money, output, and prices was weakening – the money demand function was shifting. This is one reason why central banks moved away from strict money supply targets to interest rate targets and inflation targeting frameworks by the 1990s: the link between measured money supply and inflation became harder to discern in real time[29][30]. Empirical Variability in the Money-Inflation Relationship: The long-run correlation between money growth and inflation is strong across broad samples and extreme cases, but over shorter horizons and moderate inflation environments the relationship can be obscured by other factors. Studies have found that when inflation is low and stable, money growth often does not closely predict inflation – velocity may fluctuate or other forces (like supply/demand shocks) dominate short-run inflation dynamics[31]. For instance, in the two decades before the 2020s, many advanced economies saw relatively high growth in central bank money (due to quantitative easing) but inflation remained low, as much of the new money was effectively stored in banks as excess reserves or was offset by declines in money velocity. A Dallas Fed analysis noted that a simple money-growth-based model would have badly under-predicted or over-predicted inflation in those years, reflecting an unstable relationship between money and inflation in environments where inflation expectations are anchored[32]. This does not invalidate the QTM in the long run, but it shows that the short-to-medium run link can loosen. When the regime changes – as in 2021 when inflation re-emerged – the link appeared to strengthen again, reminding us that context matters[17][33]. The BIS (Bank for International Settlements) recently reported that money growth tends to be a more reliable indicator of inflation during high-inflation regimes than in low-inflation regimes[31]. In summary, the QTM’s assumption of a stable velocity is more of a conditional truth; velocity can be volatile, and policy must take that into account. Definition of Money and Financial Innovation: Classical theory assumes a clear definition of “money” – often implicitly referring to currency or a narrow aggregate. In practice, money comes in different forms (cash, checking deposits, savings accounts, money market funds, etc.), and the boundary between money and other financial assets can shift. If people move funds between money and near-money assets, the effective money supply for transactions might change even if base money doesn’t, affecting velocity calculations. Over the years, definitions like \\(M1\\), \\(M2\\), \\(M3\\) were created, and their velocities behaved differently. The classical story is simplified and doesn’t fully capture these complexities of a modern credit-based monetary system where commercial banks create money (via lending) and central bank control is mostly indirect. It turned out to be challenging to find a monetary aggregate that has both a stable velocity and strong link to inflation in real time. This is another reason why central banks in practice target interest rates rather than the money supply nowadays – they can more directly influence economic conditions through rates, whereas controlling money growth alone proved insufficient when velocity shifted. The classical theory’s implications remain true in the long run (too much broad money growth will eventually cause inflation), but short-run monetary policy must deal with uncertainty in money demand. Economic Conditions (Liquidity Traps and Confidence): In some extreme situations, changes in the money supply may have little effect on either prices or output – a situation known as a liquidity trap. This occurs, for example, when interest rates are near zero and investors have essentially infinite demand for liquidity (money) at that rate. In a liquidity trap (as during the Great Depression or Japan in the 1990s or globally in the late 2000s), increasing the money supply might simply lead to people holding more cash (an increase in \\(k\\)) with no increase in spending – thus neither output nor prices rise much. This scenario is outside the classical theory, which assumes away such pathological cases. It required Keynesian analysis to explain: when confidence is shattered and interest rates are at the lower bound, the classical dichotomy breaks down completely – money is non-neutral even in potentially long periods because prices may even fall (deflation) despite monetary expansion. Fortunately, such traps are rare, but the possibility highlights that the neutrality of money is not a universal law but a conditional outcome. Integration with Real Finance and Interest Rates: The classical theory in its pure form abstracts from how money interacts with interest rates and asset markets. In reality, a change in the money supply can affect interest rates (at least in the short run before prices adjust), which in turn can affect investment and consumption. The classical model assumed the loanable funds market adjusts interest rates based on saving and investment, independent of the money supply. However, if the central bank injects money, it may temporarily lower interest rates (if we hold prices fixed in the very short run), causing real effects – this is essentially the Keynesian transmission mechanism. Modern New Classical and New Keynesian models have incorporated money or monetary policy into a broader framework with interest rate rules and expectations, something the simplistic classical model does not do. Contemporary challenges – Digital Currencies: A very modern consideration is how digital currencies and fintech innovations affect the classical theory. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, or central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), represent new forms of money (or quasi-money). Do they change the quantity theory? So far, there is no evidence that they overturn basic monetary principles – the classical logic would still apply to an economy’s overall money supply broadly defined. For instance, one empirical study found “no change in velocity or the money multiplier after the rise of cryptocurrencies”, suggesting that the advent of crypto has not materially altered aggregate money demand or the effectiveness of monetary policy[34]. However, digital innovations can affect \\(k\\) in the Cambridge equation by making transactions easier (potentially raising velocity) or introducing alternative assets that serve some functions of money. Central banks are closely watching these developments. The consensus is that while the forms of money are evolving, the fundamental constraint – that if too much liquidity chases too few goods, the value of money will drop – remains as true as ever. Digital currencies might change how we measure and control the money supply, but they do not negate the classical long-run link between money and prices. In light of these limitations, modern macroeconomists view the classical theory of money as a long-run benchmark rather than a complete description for all time horizons. It offers a valid intuition for why sustained money growth leads to inflation (and conversely, why controlling money growth can stabilize prices). However, for short-run analysis and policy design, we use more elaborate frameworks that account for price stickiness, expectations, and financial frictions (for example, the IS-LM model in Keynesian tradition or New Keynesian dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models). These frameworks relax the classical dichotomy – allowing monetary policy to have real effects in the short run – while typically still embedding long-run neutrality of money as a special case. Central banks today generally target inflation directly (often through interest-rate policy) rather than the money supply, implicitly acknowledging that velocity is unstable in the short run. Yet, the spirit of the quantity theory survives: central bankers recognize that excessive money creation will ultimately be inflationary[35], and keeping inflation low and stable in the long run requires not letting money grow far out of line with the economy’s capacity to produce goods and services. Summary Walrasian Foundations: The classical theory is built on a Walrasian general equilibrium of the real economy, where flexible prices ensure all markets clear. In a barter setting, only relative prices are determined; a purely real model cannot pin down the absolute price level[2]. Money as a Veil: Introducing money separates real and nominal variables. The classical dichotomy holds that real economic outcomes (output, relative prices, real interest rates) are determined by real factors, independent of the money supply[5]. Money provides a unit of account and medium of exchange but is a “veil” over the real economy – changing the money supply only changes nominal prices, not the real allocation of resources[1]. Neutrality of Money: In the classical view, money is neutral in both the long run and (in the absence of frictions) the short run. A change in the money supply leads to an equal proportional change in the price level and other nominal values, leaving real GDP, employment, and real interest rates unaffected[6]. This implies that inflation is fundamentally a monetary phenomenon in the long term. Historical episodes of high inflation underscore this one-to-one link between money growth and prices[36][11]. Cambridge Equation and QTM: The classical theory determines the price level via the Cambridge cash-balance equation \\(M = kPY\\), which is equivalent to the quantity equation \\(MV = PY\\) with \\(V = 1/k\\). This formalizes the Quantity Theory of Money (QTM) – assuming stable velocity (or cash-holding ratio \\(k\\)) and exogenous output, the money supply governs the nominal GDP and price level[15][17]. Excess money supply, given output, bids up prices until money market equilibrium is restored. Contemporary Relevance: The classical theory provides a crucial baseline for thinking about inflation and monetary policy. It correctly predicts that countries with persistently rapid money growth (relative to output) experience high inflation[37]. Monetarist policies in the 1970s–80s were inspired by this theory and had success in curbing inflation by restraining money growth[21]. Even today, surges in the money supply (e.g. during the COVID-19 crisis) are closely watched for inflationary impact[25]. Limitations: In practice, the strict classical dichotomy breaks down in the short run. Because of sticky prices, variable velocity, and financial complexities, money is not always neutral in the short-to-medium term. Velocity can shift due to changes in interest rates or public confidence, weakening the link between money and prices[28][32]. Accordingly, modern central banks target inflation via interest rates and other tools rather than fixing the money supply growth alone. The classical theory is best viewed as a long-run anchor – in the long run, excessive money creation will cause inflation – but with the understanding that short-run dynamics can deviate from the classical predictions.

    "text": "Question 3\nIn the example of three agents and three goods which is discussed in the lectures, can you think of an alternative to the use of a medium of exchange that might have allowed the three traders to acquire their most preferred good?\nContext: - Harriet: 6 Bananas ≻ 3 Apples ≻ 1 Cabbage - Ina: 1 Cabbage ≻ 6 Bananas ≻ 3 Apples - Jamal: 3 Apples ≻ 1 Cabbage ≻ 6 Bananas\n\nIndicative Answer\nAlternative mechanisms to the use of a medium of exchange:\n1. Middleman/Clearinghouse approach: In the three-trader example, one trader could accept their least preferred good to facilitate the chain of exchanges. For instance, if Ina accepts Apples from Harriet (her least preferred), she can then trade with Jamal to get Cabbage (her most preferred).\nProblem: This requires perfect knowledge of who has what and who wants what. Search and informational frictions make this risky.\n2. Multilateral simultaneous trades: All traders meet at once and exchange cooperatively (Ina gives Bananas to Harriet, who gives Apples to Jamal, who gives Cabbage to Ina - all simultaneously).\nProblem: This becomes extremely difficult with many traders and goods. Coordination costs are prohibitive.\nConclusion: The use of a MoE simplifies all these complications and reduces transaction costs significantly."

    "text": "Abstract. Money reduces the frictions of decentralised exchange by providing a unit of account, a medium of exchange, and a store of value. This note sets out those functions, illustrates why barter scales poorly, and connects liquidity, search frictions, and macro perspectives on money.\n\n\n\nMoney is a core institution of modern economies. A practical working definition is that money is any asset that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services in a given economic community. The defining feature here is general acceptability: an agent accepts money in exchange not because they wish to consume it, but because they expect others to accept it in subsequent transactions.\nMoney matters because it makes decentralised exchange feasible at scale. In a pure barter economy, trade requires a double coincidence of wants: each party must have what the other desires (Jevons, 1875/1876). This requirement is restrictive and generates significant transaction costs. Money relaxes this constraint by allowing exchange to occur in (at least) two steps: sell what you have for money, then use money to purchase what you want.\nHistorically, many objects have served monetary roles: commodity monies (e.g., gold and silver), representative monies (claims redeemable into a commodity), and, today, fiat money issued by the state and/or central bank. Modern fiat money is not redeemable for a commodity and is intrinsically worthless in consumption terms; its value is sustained by institutional frameworks, legal and tax structures, and credibility. In the contemporary economy, money exists in multiple forms: physical currency, bank deposits transferable through payment systems, and central-bank reserves used for interbank settlement.\nThis chapter is organised around the canonical functions of money:\n\nUnit of account (the economy’s common measure of value),\nMedium of exchange (the means of payment in transactions),\nStore of value (an asset held over time).\n\nWe then analyse liquidity—the property that links money to broader asset markets—and conclude with the contrast between Classical and Keynesian perspectives on money’s macroeconomic importance (Keynes, 1936).\n\n\n\n\nA unit of account is a common measure in which prices and values are expressed. This role is conceptually distinct from the medium-of-exchange role: a society could in principle use an abstract unit of account for pricing and contracting while settling transactions with other assets. In practice, however, the monetary unit (pounds, euros, dollars) typically serves as the unit of account.\n\n\nThe most fundamental object in valuation is the relative price (or exchange ratio): how many units of one good exchange for one unit of another.\nWithout a unit of account, describing values requires listing pairwise exchange ratios for all goods. The number of required exchange ratios grows quickly with the number of goods. With n goods, a complete barter price system requires \\(\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\\) exchange ratios. For large n, this is approximately \\(n^2/2\\), which becomes unmanageable as product variety increases.\nA unit of account dramatically reduces informational complexity. If each good has a money price, only n prices need to be quoted, and any relative price can be computed as a ratio of two money prices. This is the economy of measurement created by money as unit of account.\n\n\n\nThe unit-of-account function is most useful when the unit is relatively stable in purchasing power. If the unit itself changes value unpredictably, it is like trying to measure length with a ruler that keeps changing size. Inflation makes price comparisons harder, disrupts long-term contracting, and increases the resources devoted to repricing and indexation.\nIn high-inflation or hyperinflation episodes, domestic money often fails as a unit of account and people may shift to a foreign currency (partial “dollarisation”) or to indexed units. For example, Venezuela experienced extremely high inflation in the late 2010s, and pricing and saving behaviour increasingly moved toward stable foreign currencies (IMF DataMapper, n.d.). The general economic point is that price stability supports the unit-of-account role; instability undermines it.\n\n\n\nPost‑2010 innovations highlight that being technologically novel is not sufficient to become a unit of account. Many cryptocurrencies are highly volatile, which makes them unattractive as pricing units for everyday goods and services. Even where legal experiments occurred—such as El Salvador’s 2021 Bitcoin legal tender policy—prices and contracts largely remained denominated in dollars, not Bitcoin, consistent with the idea that a unit of account requires stability and broad trust. IMF programme documentation reports that legal changes in 2025 removed key legal-tender features (including the obligation to accept Bitcoin), reflecting limited adoption and significant policy concerns (IMF, 2025).\nBy contrast, stablecoins seek to inherit stability by pegging to a fiat unit (usually the U.S. dollar). Their “moneyness” therefore depends on the credibility of the peg and on the legal/financial structures backing the promise of convertibility.\n\n\n\n\n\nA medium of exchange is an asset that agents accept in exchange for goods and services with the intention of using it to purchase other goods and services in the future. This function is the most visible and is closely tied to money’s central economic contribution: reducing transaction costs.\n\n\nBarter trade is a one-step exchange of one good for another. A monetary transaction typically involves two steps (sell for money, then buy with money), which may appear more complex at first glance. The key point is that barter requires a double coincidence of wants. In a decentralised economy with many goods and heterogeneous preferences, satisfying this condition is rare and costly.\nJevons (1875/1876) emphasised that the main friction is not conceptual but practical: it is costly to search for a counterparty who both has what you want and wants what you have. Monetary exchange solves this problem by allowing trade with any counterparty who accepts money, which—by definition—is “everyone.” ### A concrete example: three agents and three goods {#three-agents-example}\nTo illustrate the problem of the double coincidence of wants, consider three traders and three goods:\n\nHarriet has 6 Bananas; she prefers: Bananas (6) ≻ Apples (3) ≻ Cabbage (1)\nIna has 1 Cabbage; she prefers: Cabbage (1) ≻ Bananas (6) ≻ Apples (3)\nJamal has 3 Apples; he prefers: Apples (3) ≻ Cabbage (1) ≻ Bananas (6)\n\nEach trader ends up with their least preferred good. Under pure barter, achieving mutual benefit is complicated:\n\nHarriet wants to trade her Bananas for Apples (Jamal’s good), but Jamal wants to trade his Apples for Cabbage (Ina’s good), not Bananas.\nIna wants to trade her Cabbage for Bananas (Harriet’s good), but Harriet wants Apples, not Cabbage.\n\nWithout a medium of exchange, all three traders would need to coordinate a multilateral trade: Harriet gives Bananas to Ina, Jamal gives Apples to Harriet, and Ina gives Cabbage to Jamal—all simultaneously. This requires perfect knowledge of each other’s preferences and strict temporal coordination.\nWith a widely accepted medium of exchange (money), the problem vanishes: each trader sells their current good for money, then uses money to purchase their preferred good. Transaction costs are dramatically reduced, and agents can trade independently rather than relying on simultaneous trilateral coordination. ### Trading posts, market structure, and the economy of exchange\nA useful way to see the role of a medium of exchange is to imagine that, without money, an economy would require a dense network of “trading posts” or market arrangements for each pair of goods. With n goods, \\(\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\\) bilateral trading posts would be needed for direct barter across all pairs, which scales poorly. With money as a medium of exchange, each good needs only a market against money, and any two goods can be traded indirectly through money. This is the economy of exchange that money provides.\n\n\n\nModern monetary economics formalised these intuitions in search-theoretic models. In seminal work, Kiyotaki and Wright (1989) show that under trading frictions, certain assets can become accepted as media of exchange because they lower transaction costs and increase the probability of successful trade. Later work (Kiyotaki & Wright, 1993) provides a broader framework for monetary exchange as a solution to decentralised trading problems.\nThese models help clarify why acceptability is both cause and consequence of being money: an asset is accepted because others accept it, creating a network effect. But acceptance is not arbitrary; assets with suitable properties (portability, durability, divisibility, and low verification cost) are more likely to emerge as media of exchange.\n\n\n\nIn modern economies, many transactions are executed electronically. Cards, mobile wallets, and real-time transfer systems are payment technologies layered on top of money. Under the hood, settlement typically occurs in central bank money (reserves and cash) and bank deposit money denominated in the national unit of account.\nCryptocurrencies have been proposed as alternative payment instruments. Empirical work suggests that, in many jurisdictions, their use as everyday payment media has been limited (Umlauft, 2018). Where adoption has been attempted at national scale, the outcomes underline the importance of stability, infrastructure, regulation, and trust.\n\n\n\n\n\nMoney also functions as a store of value: it transfers purchasing power through time. This function follows naturally from the medium-of-exchange role because sales and purchases are often separated by time; in that gap, money is held as an asset.\nHowever, money is not the only store of value. Bonds, equities, property, and other assets store value and often deliver higher returns. Money’s comparative advantage is liquidity—the capacity to be used immediately as a means of payment.\n\n\nBecause money typically yields little or no interest, holding money involves an opportunity cost: the foregone return from holding an interest-bearing asset instead. This opportunity cost is a key determinant of money demand.\nKeynes (1936) emphasised that agents demand money not only for transactions but also for liquidity as a store of value under uncertainty. In this framework, the interest rate can be interpreted as a premium required to induce agents to hold less liquid assets instead of money.\n\n\n\nInflation erodes the real value of nominal money balances. Over long horizons, cash is typically a poor store of value unless nominal interest on liquid balances compensates for inflation. When inflation is high and unpredictable, agents shift into alternative stores of value (foreign currency, real assets, indexed claims), weakening money’s store-of-value role and potentially destabilising the monetary system.\nRecent macroeconomic experience renewed attention to these issues. Following the COVID‑19 shock, several advanced economies experienced the highest inflation rates in decades. A large empirical literature examines the roles of supply constraints, fiscal expansion, and monetary conditions; as part of this debate, BIS research has argued that money growth helps explain cross-country variation in the inflation surge, especially when inflation moves into higher regimes (Borio, Hofmann, & Zakrajšek, 2023; Borio, Hofmann, & Zakrajšek, 2024).\n\n\n\n\n\nLiquidity is a central concept linking money to asset markets and financial stability. A practical definition is:\n\nLiquidity is the ease with which an asset can be exchanged for goods and services (or converted into a generally accepted means of payment) quickly, predictably, and with little loss of value.\n\nMoney is the most liquid asset. Other assets are “money-like” to the extent that they can be converted into money rapidly at low cost and low risk.\n\n\nLiquidity is commonly associated with:\n\nMarketability (active markets and many potential buyers),\nPredictability of exchange value (low short-run price volatility),\nReversibility (small bid–ask spreads and low transaction costs),\nDivisibility (capacity to trade in small denominations).\n\nThese criteria help explain why agents are often willing to hold money despite its low return: they obtain liquidity services in exchange for foregoing interest.\n\n\n\nBecause liquidity is a spectrum, monetary authorities define multiple monetary aggregates. Narrow measures (e.g., currency and demand deposits) are most liquid. Broader measures include less liquid but still money-like instruments (e.g., some savings deposits).\nIn the U.S., widely used series include M2, available through the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis FRED database (Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, n.d.). While definitions differ across countries, the central idea is consistent: as aggregates broaden, liquidity declines and return often increases.\n\n\n\nLiquidity conditions can change abruptly in crises. Even normally liquid markets can become illiquid when risk aversion spikes and balance sheets are constrained, producing a “flight to liquidity.” This is one reason central banks maintain lender-of-last-resort frameworks and market backstops to prevent liquidity shocks from turning into solvency crises and macroeconomic contractions.\n\n\n\nCBDCs are frequently analysed as potential new forms of sovereign money, designed to be safe and highly liquid. The Atlantic Council’s CBDC Tracker reports that a large share of countries are exploring, piloting, or developing CBDCs (Atlantic Council, n.d.). If introduced at scale, CBDCs could reshape retail payments, alter the composition of liquid assets held by households, and raise new questions for banking-sector funding and financial stability.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe macroeconomic importance of money is often introduced through a contrast between Classical and Keynesian approaches.\n\n\nIn classical monetary thought, money is essential for transactions but largely neutral in the long run: changes in the money supply affect nominal variables (such as prices) but not real variables (such as output and employment), once prices fully adjust. This idea underpins the classical dichotomy and long-run neutrality propositions often associated with quantity-theoretic reasoning.\n\n\n\nKeynes argued that money is not only a medium of exchange and unit of account; it is also a store of value held for liquidity under uncertainty (Keynes, 1936). Because agents can choose to hoard money, shifts in liquidity preference can spill over into asset markets and goods markets, affecting interest rates, investment, and aggregate demand. Under price and wage rigidities, these monetary and financial conditions can affect real output and employment in the short and medium run.\n\n\n\nContemporary macroeconomics typically combines elements of both traditions: money is often viewed as approximately neutral in the long run, but monetary policy and liquidity conditions are central to short-run fluctuations. Modern frameworks often focus on interest rates and financial conditions rather than money aggregates alone (e.g., Woodford, 2003), but the post‑pandemic inflation episode revived interest in money growth and liquidity alongside standard policy-rate channels (Borio et al., 2023; 2024).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy does the number of required barter exchange ratios grow so rapidly as the number of goods increases? What informational problem does money solve?\nIn what sense is a stable unit of account a public good? How does inflation undermine it?\nUsing the idea of opportunity cost, explain why higher nominal interest rates typically reduce desired money holdings.\nWhy might a technologically superior payment instrument fail as “money” if it lacks broad acceptability?\nHow could CBDCs change the composition of liquid assets held by households and the banking sector?",

    "text": "The macroeconomic importance of money is often introduced through a contrast between Classical and Keynesian approaches.\n\n\nIn classical monetary thought, money is essential for transactions but largely neutral in the long run: changes in the money supply affect nominal variables (such as prices) but not real variables (such as output and employment), once prices fully adjust. This idea underpins the classical dichotomy and long-run neutrality propositions often associated with quantity-theoretic reasoning.\n\n\n\nKeynes argued that money is not only a medium of exchange and unit of account; it is also a store of value held for liquidity under uncertainty (Keynes, 1936). Because agents can choose to hoard money, shifts in liquidity preference can spill over into asset markets and goods markets, affecting interest rates, investment, and aggregate demand. Under price and wage rigidities, these monetary and financial conditions can affect real output and employment in the short and medium run.\n\n\n\nContemporary macroeconomics typically combines elements of both traditions: money is often viewed as approximately neutral in the long run, but monetary policy and liquidity conditions are central to short-run fluctuations. Modern frameworks often focus on interest rates and financial conditions rather than money aggregates alone (e.g., Woodford, 2003), but the post‑pandemic inflation episode revived interest in money growth and liquidity alongside standard policy-rate channels (Borio et al., 2023; 2024).",

    "title": "Classical Theory of Money",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The classical theory of money is an approach in macroeconomics asserting that money primarily influences nominal variables (prices, wages) and has negligible effect on real economic activity (output, employment) in the long run. Classical economists often say “money is a veil”, meaning that the system of money prices may obscure real economic relationships, but in reality the underlying real economy is unchanged by the quantity of money in circulation[1]. This theory, rooted in the 19th-century Walrasian general equilibrium framework and the early 20th-century Quantity Theory of Money, underpins the view that sustained changes in the money supply lead to proportional changes in the price level, with real variables determined by real factors like technology and preferences. In this reading, we outline the classical model of a monetary economy and its key implications – the Walrasian system of general equilibrium, the classical dichotomy between real and monetary sectors, the neutrality of money, the Cambridge equation of exchange, and the Quantity Theory of Money (QTM) – and discuss how these ideas hold up with contemporary examples. We also examine the limitations of the classical view, including situations (such as short-run economic fluctuations or extreme policy environments) where money may not be neutral and why modern economists and central banks have nuanced this theory.\n\n\n\nClassical theory builds on the Walrasian general equilibrium model of a barter economy (named after Léon Walras, 1834–1910, a pioneer of mathematical economics). In a Walrasian system, all markets for goods and services simultaneously clear through price adjustment. Formally, it consists of a set of market-clearing conditions (one for each good or factor) and a corresponding set of relative prices that adjust to equate supply and demand in every market[2]. Importantly, only relative prices matter in this system – prices are expressed in terms of one another (for instance, how many units of good A trade for one unit of good B). One good can be chosen as a numéraire (unit of account) to price all other goods, fixing the scale for relative prices.\nBecause all prices in Walrasian equilibrium are determined only up to a common scale, the model exhibits homogeneity: if all prices were doubled (or halved), the real allocations of goods would remain the same. This implies that in a purely real economy without money, the absolute price level is indeterminate – there is no unique solution for “the” price level, only for relative prices. In other words, the Walrasian model determines what and how much gets produced and consumed (real output and relative price ratios), but not the overall monetary value of those goods. Walras’ Law holds that if all but one markets are in equilibrium, the last market must also clear (excess supply in one market must be matched by excess demand in at least one other), ensuring consistency of the general equilibrium[3][4].\nIn this frictionless, barter-style economy, real variables – such as real output, the allocation of goods, and relative prices – are determined entirely by real factors (preferences, endowments, technology) without any reference to the money supply. This is the foundation of the classical idea that money is nonessential in determining real economic outcomes. However, to analyze an economy with money (a monetary economy), we need to introduce money into the Walrasian system in a way that pins down the general price level.\n\n\n\nThe introduction of money into the model leads to what is known as the classical dichotomy – a strict separation between the determination of real variables and nominal variables. According to the classical dichotomy, real variables (such as real GDP, real consumption, employment, and relative prices of goods) are determined independently of nominal variables (such as the absolute price level, inflation rate, and nominal money supply)[5]. In practical terms, one can first solve for the real equilibrium of the economy (the allocation of resources and relative prices as if it were a barter economy), and then determine the nominal price level by considering the money market. The presence of money serves only to convert the barter terms of trade into monetary terms; it does not alter the underlying real equilibrium.\nThis dichotomy reflects the notion that money is neutral in its effect on the real economy, an idea we explore more below. In the classical view, money’s sole function in general equilibrium is to determine the units in which prices are quoted – essentially acting as a unit of account and medium of exchange without changing real outcomes. Walras’s model extended to include money treats money as an additional “good” for which supply and demand must equilibrate, but crucially, changes in the supply of money do not affect the equilibrium quantities of other goods or relative prices (they only affect absolute nominal prices). The system of equations describing the economy can thus be partitioned into a real subsystem and a monetary subsystem, with minimal feedback from the monetary side to the real side – this is the essence of the classical dichotomy[5].\nHistorically, classical economists like David Hume illustrated the dichotomy with thought experiments: if overnight every person’s stock of money doubled, people would initially feel wealthier and try to spend more, but with no change in the real quantity of goods, prices would soon double as well. Ultimately, the economy would be in the same real state as before, just with all prices (and monetary values) scaled up. The real output, employment, and relative prices would be unchanged – only the monetary values differ. This parable encapsulates the classical dichotomy by showing that real wealth hasn’t changed even though nominal money holdings did.\n\n\n\nFrom the classical dichotomy stems the principle of the neutrality of money. Money is said to be neutral if changes in the stock of money have no effect on real economic variables (like real output or the real interest rate), affecting only nominal variables (like the price level or nominal incomes). In the classical theory, with flexible prices and wages, money is neutral even in the short run. A change in the money supply – whether through gold discoveries in a classical gold standard economy or open-market operations by a central bank – will proportionally change all money prices but leave real production and consumption decisions unaltered[6].\nLong-run monetary neutrality is a core implication: for example, a permanent doubling of the money supply is predicted to eventually lead to a doubling of the price level (a 100% inflation), with real GDP, employment, and real interest rates returning to their original levels[7]. In classical thought, this adjustment happens relatively quickly as prices are fully flexible. All agents understand that only nominal values have changed, so there is no lasting effect on output or other real magnitudes.\nHow does this adjustment occur? We can think in terms of supply and demand for money. Suppose the economy’s real output \\(Y\\) and money demand behavior are initially given, and the central bank unexpectedly doubles the money supply (\\(M\\)). At the old price level \\(P_0\\), there is now excess supply of money – people have more money than they desire to hold relative to goods. They will try to get rid of the excess money balances by increasing spending on goods and services (or purchasing assets). This creates an excess demand for goods (equivalently, an excess demand for all non-money assets) by Walras’ Law[8]. With more money chasing the same amount of goods, prices begin to rise. Higher prices reduce the real purchasing power of the excess money, thereby reducing the excess money balances. The price level will continue to rise until the real value of the money supply \\(M/P\\) has increased enough that people are willing to hold the entire new money supply. At the new equilibrium, the price level \\(P_1\\) will be higher (in fact, roughly double \\(P_0\\) in this scenario), such that the ratio \\(M/P\\) is restored to the original real money demand. Real variables (the quantity of goods produced and consumed) remain the same, but all nominal prices have doubled. Essentially, the equilibrium shifts from \\((M_0, P_0)\\) to \\((M_1, P_1)\\), with \\(M_1 = 2 M_0\\) and \\(P_1 \\approx 2 P_0\\), so that the real money supply \\(M_1/P_1\\) equals the original \\(M_0/P_0\\).\nTo visualize money neutrality, consider a simple money market diagram (value of money on the vertical axis and quantity of money on the horizontal axis). The demand for money is downward sloping in terms of the value of money (i.e. \\(1/P\\)) – at higher price levels (lower \\(1/P\\)), people need to hold more nominal money for transactions, so the demand for nominal balances increases as \\(1/P\\) falls. The supply of money is fixed exogenously by the central bank (a vertical line at the given \\(M\\)). Equilibrium occurs where money supply equals money demand, determining the equilibrium \\(1/P\\). Now, if the money supply increases (the vertical line shifts to the right), the intersection with the demand curve moves downward – the equilibrium value of money \\(1/P\\) falls, which means the price level \\(P\\) rises in proportion to the increase in \\(M\\). The following figure illustrates this outcome:\nIllustration: Equilibrium in the money market determines the value of money (the inverse of the price level). The demand for money (\\(D_M\\)) is downward sloping in terms of \\(1/P\\), and the money supply (\\(S_M\\)) is vertical (fixed by policy). An increase in the money supply from \\(M_0\\) to \\(M_1\\) shifts the supply curve rightward, causing the equilibrium value of money to drop from \\(1/P_0\\) to \\(1/P_1\\) – equivalently, the price level \\(P\\) rises. In classical theory, real output (\\(Y\\)) and money demand parameters are unchanged, so this change in \\(P\\) leaves real variables unaffected.[9]\nIn the classical long-run perspective, empirical evidence does show that countries with persistently higher money growth tend to have higher inflation, consistent with money neutrality in the long term. Cross-country studies find a close one-to-one relationship between the rate of money growth (in excess of real GDP growth) and the inflation rate in the long run[10]. For example, during episodes of hyperinflation, excessive money creation clearly leads to soaring prices: Zimbabwe’s central bank, by printing money in the 2000s, contributed to one of the worst hyperinflations on record – at its peak in 2008, prices in Zimbabwe were estimated to be rising at an astronomical rate of 500 billion percent per year[11]. Such extreme cases demonstrate that pouring huge amounts of money into an economy with limited output will drastically reduce money’s value (raise the price level). In more moderate circumstances too, “if the money supply grows too big relative to the size of an economy, the unit value of the currency diminishes – its purchasing power falls and prices rise”[12], which is precisely the quantity theory prediction.\nIt should be noted, however, that classical theory abstracts from short-run frictions. In reality, prices and wages may not adjust immediately (they can be sticky in the short run), so a sudden increase in the money supply might temporarily boost real activity – a possibility acknowledged even by later monetarist economists[13]. The classical model, though, assumes away these short-run rigidities, focusing on the ultimate outcome after prices have fully adjusted. In that full-adjustment scenario, money is neutral: aside from the price level and other nominal values, nothing real has changed.\n\n\n\nTo determine the price level in a monetary economy, classical economists augmented the Walrasian real system with an equation describing money demand – famously formulated by the Cambridge school of economists (Alfred Marshall, A.C. Pigou, and even a young John Maynard Keynes) in the early 1900s. The Cambridge equation (or cash-balance equation) focuses on the demand for money as a proportion of income. It can be expressed as:\nwhere \\(M^d\\) is the desired nominal money holdings (money demand), \\(P\\) is the general price level, \\(Y\\) is real national income (real output), and \\(k\\) is a parameter representing the fraction of nominal income that people wish to hold in the form of money (their cash holding ratio). In equilibrium, we assume the money market clears, so the supply of money \\(M\\) equals money demand \\(M^d\\). Thus, the Cambridge equilibrium condition is:\nThis simple equation embodies the idea that people plan to hold a certain proportion \\(k\\) of their income in cash balances for convenience and safety. The value of \\(k\\) reflects factors like payment habits, financial technology, and preferences for liquidity – for example, if people keep one month’s worth of income as cash on average, \\(k\\) might be about \\(1/12 \\approx 0.08\\). The velocity of money \\(V\\) is the inverse of this cash-balance ratio: . Velocity \\(V\\) measures how many times per period the average unit of currency is spent on final goods and services (i.e. how quickly money circulates). If \\(k=0.1\\), then \\(V=10\\), meaning each dollar (or pound, etc.) is used to purchase 10 dollars’ worth of output per period on average.\nThe Cambridge equation can be rewritten to make the price level the subject:\nThis tells us that for a given real output \\(Y\\) and given money demand parameter \\(k\\), the price level \\(P\\) adjusts in proportion to the money supply \\(M\\). In other words, the quantity of money in circulation relative to the economy’s output (adjusted by how much money people want to hold) determines the price level. If the money supply doubles, then unless there is a change in \\(Y\\) or \\(k\\), the price level must double to maintain the equality \\(M = k P Y\\). In the classical model, \\(Y\\) is determined by real factors (and in the long run by things like technology and resources), and \\(k\\) is assumed to be stable (or exogenously given by institutions and preferences). Therefore, any change in \\(M\\) translates to an proportional change in \\(P\\). This Cambridge equation thus fills the gap in the Walrasian system: whereas the Walrasian real equilibrium couldn’t pin down the absolute level of prices, adding the money market equilibrium condition (\\(M\\) supply equals \\(M^d = kPY\\) demand) yields a solution for the nominal price level[14]. The classical dichotomy is evident here – the real variable \\(Y\\) is solved elsewhere, and once \\(Y\\) is known, the nominal variable \\(P\\) adjusts to satisfy the money equation given \\(M\\).\nIt’s worth noting that the Cambridge cash-balance approach is just a different perspective on the quantity theory of money, emphasizing money demand instead of supply. Unlike the “transactions” version of the quantity theory (associated with American economist Irving Fisher, discussed next), which treats velocity as given and focuses on the flow of money spending, the Cambridge equation arises from thinking about how much of their income people wish to hold in monetary form at any time. Both approaches, however, arrive at a similar conclusion: a linkage between the money supply and nominal income. Indeed, if we take the Cambridge equation and multiply both sides by \\(V = 1/k\\), we get \\(M \\cdot V = P \\cdot Y\\). Thus the Cambridge equation is mathematically equivalent to the more famous equation of exchange, as long as we identify \\(V = 1/k\\)[15]. The two formulations differ subtly in interpretation – the classical (Fisherian) view tends to treat \\(V\\) as a constant technical parameter and money as only a medium of exchange, whereas the Cambridge view gives \\(k\\) (hence \\(V\\)) a behavioral interpretation and recognizes money’s role as a store of value that people may desire to hold. But in the strict classical theory, \\(k\\) (and hence \\(V\\)) was taken to be fairly stable in the short run, so the distinction did not undermine the overall prediction.\n\n\n\nThe Quantity Theory of Money is the centerpiece of classical monetary theory. It is often summarized by the equation of exchange:\nHere \\(M\\) is the money supply, \\(V\\) is the velocity of money, \\(P\\) is the price level, and \\(Y\\) is real output (often \\(Y\\) is taken to be real GDP for the whole economy). This equation is an identity – it defines velocity \\(V\\) as the ratio of nominal GDP (\\(P \\times Y\\)) to the money stock \\(M\\). It says that the total amount of money multiplied by the number of times each unit of money is used to buy goods (velocity) equals the total monetary value of goods purchased (\\(P \\times Y\\)) in the economy. As an accounting statement, this always holds true by construction in any given period.\nThe equation of exchange becomes a powerful theory (the QTM) with one key additional assumption: velocity \\(V\\) is constant (or at least predictable), and independent of other variables, and real output \\(Y\\) is determined by non-monetary factors (e.g. resources and technology, as in the Walrasian real system). Under these assumptions, any change in \\(M\\) must be reflected primarily in \\(P\\). In growth rate form, the quantity theory predicts that the inflation rate (growth of \\(P\\)) will equal the growth rate of money minus the growth rate of real output (since \\(V\\) is constant)[16]. For example, if the money supply grows 5% per year and real GDP grows 2% per year, QTM would predict roughly 3% annual inflation in the long run (5% – 2% = 3%). In short, the Quantity Theory of Money posits a direct, proportional relationship between the money supply and the price level, when other factors are held constant[17]. It is “one of the oldest hypotheses in economics,” linking excessive money growth to inflation[18][19].\nA classical quantity theorist typically assumes that \\(V\\) is stable due to institutions or habits (for instance, people might get paid monthly and pay bills monthly, implying a regular turnover of money). Empirically, velocity does change over time, but in early 20th century economies it was often sufficiently stable in the short run that treating it as roughly constant was not a bad approximation[20]. Meanwhile, \\(Y\\) in the long run is determined by labor, capital, technology, etc., not by the money supply. Therefore, increases in \\(M\\) lead to proportionate increases in \\(P\\). This formalizes the intuition behind money neutrality. As an IMF explainer succinctly put it, “if the money supply grows too big relative to the size of an economy, the unit value of the currency diminishes – its purchasing power falls and prices rise”[12]. The Quantity Theory thus provides a mechanism for how inflation can be controlled by controlling money growth. It underlies the famous maxim by Milton Friedman (a leading 20th-century monetarist) that “inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.”\nHistorical example: The QTM was vividly demonstrated during the Great Inflation of the 1970s. In the United States and United Kingdom, rapid growth of the money supply was accompanied by surging prices. Monetarist economists, reviving the classical QTM, argued that to bring down inflation, central banks needed to restrain money growth. Indeed, in 1979 the U.S. Federal Reserve under Paul Volcker dramatically changed policy to target the money supply growth rate. By limiting money growth, the Fed was able to squeeze inflation out of the system by the early 1980s, albeit at the cost of a recession[21]. Similarly, the U.K. adopted monetarist policies under Margaret Thatcher. These policy episodes were inspired directly by QTM logic – essentially applying classical theory to practice – and they lend support to the long-run link between money and prices. Many countries thereafter maintained a focus on low money growth to keep inflation low (until the practice of inflation targeting eventually replaced direct money targets, as discussed later).\nAnother dramatic example is the relationship between money growth and hyperinflation. We mentioned Zimbabwe’s hyperinflation; similarly, classic case studies like the Weimar German hyperinflation of 1923 show a clear QTM pattern. In Weimar Germany, the government massively increased the paper money supply to finance expenses, and the price level exploded in proportion, to the point where money became nearly worthless. Such episodes reinforce that, when taken to extremes, money growth and inflation go hand-in-hand.\nIt’s important to realize that the Quantity Theory of Money (QTM), as used in classical theory, is more than just the identity \\(MV=PY\\). It is the hypothesis that causality runs from left to right: the money supply is exogenous (determined by the central bank or gold supply) and is the primary driver of nominal GDP and the price level in the long run, with velocity and real GDP growth taken as given. The QTM assumes long-run neutrality (money only affects \\(P\\)) and often also assumes dichotomy (that real output \\(Y\\) is determined independently). Under these conditions, controlling inflation is as simple as controlling money supply growth. Monetarist economists in the 20th century extended this classical theory, asserting that a stable money growth rule would lead to stable prices[22][23]. They pointed to statistical correlations between money and prices, and argued, for example, that the Great Depression of the 1930s in the U.S. was largely due to a sharp contraction of the money stock (a thesis advanced by Friedman and Schwartz in A Monetary History of the United States[24]).\nThe QTM has seen a resurgence in debate in recent years. After the Global Financial Crisis of 2007–09, central banks injected unprecedented amounts of money into economies (through quantitative easing), yet inflation in many advanced economies remained subdued for a long time in the 2010s. This led some to question whether the classical quantity relation had broken down, as velocity appeared to decline. However, following the COVID-19 pandemic, money growth spiked again (for example, U.S. M2 money supply grew over 25% year-on-year at one point in 2020), and by 2021–2022 inflation jumped to multi-decade highs. Analysts noted that a simple quantity-theoretic linkage between money and inflation seemed to reassert itself during this period[25]. In fact, a basic model using money growth did successfully signal the rise of inflation post-2020, even though it had failed to predict inflation in the prior two decades of low inflation[26][16]. This mixed record underscores that the QTM holds well under some circumstances (especially when there are large swings in money growth and when the economy is near full capacity), but can be less reliable in others – a point we now examine as we discuss the limitations of the classical view.\n\n\n\nWhile the classical theory of money provides a useful benchmark and is largely borne out in the long run, economists have long identified several limitations and caveats to its applicability. In practice, the strict classical dichotomy and money neutrality do not always hold, especially in the short run or under certain conditions. Here are some key limitations and challenges to the classical view:\nShort-Run Non-Neutrality and Price Stickiness: The classical model assumes fully flexible prices and wages that instantaneously clear markets. In reality, many prices (e.g. wages in contracts, or prices set by firms) adjust slowly. In the presence of such sticky prices, changes in the money supply can have short-term real effects. This was a central insight of John Maynard Keynes and later Keynesian economics: if the money supply increases, in the short run it may lower interest rates and stimulate investment and consumption, thus increasing real output and employment – contrary to neutrality. Only over time, as prices gradually adjust, will the full effect be reflected in the price level. Keynesians argue that during recessions or periods of slack, output is demand-determined, and an increase in money (and thus demand) can raise output rather than prices. The classical dichotomy is thus violated in the short run: real and nominal variables are intertwined. Modern empirical research confirms that money is not neutral in the short term – for instance, expansionary monetary policy often boosts real GDP for a couple of years before inflation catches up. Even monetarist economists accept the idea of short-run monetary nonneutrality due to lags in price adjustment[13]. The long-run neutrality may still hold, but the journey matters for economic fluctuations.\nUnstable Velocity and Money Demand: The classical QTM assumes velocity (\\(V\\)) or the Cambridge \\(k\\) is fixed (or at least exogenous and stable). In reality, velocity can and does change due to various factors – interest rates, financial innovation, payment technologies, and economic uncertainty can all affect how much money people want to hold relative to income. Keynes, in his critique of the classical theory, introduced the idea of speculative demand for money (part of his liquidity preference theory), suggesting that \\(k\\) is not a constant but depends on the interest rate: when interest rates are low, people are less incentivized to hold bonds and more content holding money, so money demand rises (velocity falls), and vice versa. He also noted that expectations of deflation or financial turmoil can make people hoard cash (increasing \\(k\\) dramatically). In symbolic form, Keynesians might express money demand as \\(M^d = k(i) \\, P \\, Y\\), where \\(k\\) is a function of the nominal interest rate \\(i\\) (and perhaps other variables like expectations of inflation)[27]. This view implies that velocity is endogenous and can vary widely – which undermines the simple classical QTM prediction. Indeed, Keynesians attach little or no significance to a rigid quantity theory rule precisely because velocity is inherently unstable[28]. Empirical history vindicates this concern: for example, in the 1980s, financial deregulation and innovation in banking altered the stability of money demand in the US and UK, causing velocity of traditional aggregates (like \\(M1\\) or \\(M2\\)) to shift unpredictably. During the 1990s and 2000s, the rise of credit cards, money market funds, and later digital payment platforms continued to change money holding patterns. Central banks found that targeting a money supply growth rate (as suggested by monetarism) became unreliable because the relationship between money, output, and prices was weakening – the money demand function was shifting. This is one reason why central banks moved away from strict money supply targets to interest rate targets and inflation targeting frameworks by the 1990s: the link between measured money supply and inflation became harder to discern in real time[29][30].\nEmpirical Variability in the Money-Inflation Relationship: The long-run correlation between money growth and inflation is strong across broad samples and extreme cases, but over shorter horizons and moderate inflation environments the relationship can be obscured by other factors. Studies have found that when inflation is low and stable, money growth often does not closely predict inflation – velocity may fluctuate or other forces (like supply/demand shocks) dominate short-run inflation dynamics[31]. For instance, in the two decades before the 2020s, many advanced economies saw relatively high growth in central bank money (due to quantitative easing) but inflation remained low, as much of the new money was effectively stored in banks as excess reserves or was offset by declines in money velocity. A Dallas Fed analysis noted that a simple money-growth-based model would have badly under-predicted or over-predicted inflation in those years, reflecting an unstable relationship between money and inflation in environments where inflation expectations are anchored[32]. This does not invalidate the QTM in the long run, but it shows that the short-to-medium run link can loosen. When the regime changes – as in 2021 when inflation re-emerged – the link appeared to strengthen again, reminding us that context matters[17][33]. The BIS (Bank for International Settlements) recently reported that money growth tends to be a more reliable indicator of inflation during high-inflation regimes than in low-inflation regimes[31]. In summary, the QTM’s assumption of a stable velocity is more of a conditional truth; velocity can be volatile, and policy must take that into account.\nDefinition of Money and Financial Innovation: Classical theory assumes a clear definition of “money” – often implicitly referring to currency or a narrow aggregate. In practice, money comes in different forms (cash, checking deposits, savings accounts, money market funds, etc.), and the boundary between money and other financial assets can shift. If people move funds between money and near-money assets, the effective money supply for transactions might change even if base money doesn’t, affecting velocity calculations. Over the years, definitions like \\(M1\\), \\(M2\\), \\(M3\\) were created, and their velocities behaved differently. The classical story is simplified and doesn’t fully capture these complexities of a modern credit-based monetary system where commercial banks create money (via lending) and central bank control is mostly indirect. It turned out to be challenging to find a monetary aggregate that has both a stable velocity and strong link to inflation in real time. This is another reason why central banks in practice target interest rates rather than the money supply nowadays – they can more directly influence economic conditions through rates, whereas controlling money growth alone proved insufficient when velocity shifted. The classical theory’s implications remain true in the long run (too much broad money growth will eventually cause inflation), but short-run monetary policy must deal with uncertainty in money demand.\nEconomic Conditions (Liquidity Traps and Confidence): In some extreme situations, changes in the money supply may have little effect on either prices or output – a situation known as a liquidity trap. This occurs, for example, when interest rates are near zero and investors have essentially infinite demand for liquidity (money) at that rate. In a liquidity trap (as during the Great Depression or Japan in the 1990s or globally in the late 2000s), increasing the money supply might simply lead to people holding more cash (an increase in \\(k\\)) with no increase in spending – thus neither output nor prices rise much. This scenario is outside the classical theory, which assumes away such pathological cases. It required Keynesian analysis to explain: when confidence is shattered and interest rates are at the lower bound, the classical dichotomy breaks down completely – money is non-neutral even in potentially long periods because prices may even fall (deflation) despite monetary expansion. Fortunately, such traps are rare, but the possibility highlights that the neutrality of money is not a universal law but a conditional outcome.\nIntegration with Real Finance and Interest Rates: The classical theory in its pure form abstracts from how money interacts with interest rates and asset markets. In reality, a change in the money supply can affect interest rates (at least in the short run before prices adjust), which in turn can affect investment and consumption. The classical model assumed the loanable funds market adjusts interest rates based on saving and investment, independent of the money supply. However, if the central bank injects money, it may temporarily lower interest rates (if we hold prices fixed in the very short run), causing real effects – this is essentially the Keynesian transmission mechanism. Modern New Classical and New Keynesian models have incorporated money or monetary policy into a broader framework with interest rate rules and expectations, something the simplistic classical model does not do.\nContemporary challenges – Digital Currencies: A very modern consideration is how digital currencies and fintech innovations affect the classical theory. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, or central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), represent new forms of money (or quasi-money). Do they change the quantity theory? So far, there is no evidence that they overturn basic monetary principles – the classical logic would still apply to an economy’s overall money supply broadly defined. For instance, one empirical study found “no change in velocity or the money multiplier after the rise of cryptocurrencies”, suggesting that the advent of crypto has not materially altered aggregate money demand or the effectiveness of monetary policy[34]. However, digital innovations can affect \\(k\\) in the Cambridge equation by making transactions easier (potentially raising velocity) or introducing alternative assets that serve some functions of money. Central banks are closely watching these developments. The consensus is that while the forms of money are evolving, the fundamental constraint – that if too much liquidity chases too few goods, the value of money will drop – remains as true as ever. Digital currencies might change how we measure and control the money supply, but they do not negate the classical long-run link between money and prices.\nIn light of these limitations, modern macroeconomists view the classical theory of money as a long-run benchmark rather than a complete description for all time horizons. It offers a valid intuition for why sustained money growth leads to inflation (and conversely, why controlling money growth can stabilize prices). However, for short-run analysis and policy design, we use more elaborate frameworks that account for price stickiness, expectations, and financial frictions (for example, the IS-LM model in Keynesian tradition or New Keynesian dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models). These frameworks relax the classical dichotomy – allowing monetary policy to have real effects in the short run – while typically still embedding long-run neutrality of money as a special case. Central banks today generally target inflation directly (often through interest-rate policy) rather than the money supply, implicitly acknowledging that velocity is unstable in the short run. Yet, the spirit of the quantity theory survives: central bankers recognize that excessive money creation will ultimately be inflationary[35], and keeping inflation low and stable in the long run requires not letting money grow far out of line with the economy’s capacity to produce goods and services.\n\n\n\nWalrasian Foundations: The classical theory is built on a Walrasian general equilibrium of the real economy, where flexible prices ensure all markets clear. In a barter setting, only relative prices are determined; a purely real model cannot pin down the absolute price level[2].\nMoney as a Veil: Introducing money separates real and nominal variables. The classical dichotomy holds that real economic outcomes (output, relative prices, real interest rates) are determined by real factors, independent of the money supply[5]. Money provides a unit of account and medium of exchange but is a “veil” over the real economy – changing the money supply only changes nominal prices, not the real allocation of resources[1].\nNeutrality of Money: In the classical view, money is neutral in both the long run and (in the absence of frictions) the short run. A change in the money supply leads to an equal proportional change in the price level and other nominal values, leaving real GDP, employment, and real interest rates unaffected[6]. This implies that inflation is fundamentally a monetary phenomenon in the long term. Historical episodes of high inflation underscore this one-to-one link between money growth and prices[36][11].\nCambridge Equation and QTM: The classical theory determines the price level via the Cambridge cash-balance equation \\(M = kPY\\), which is equivalent to the quantity equation \\(MV = PY\\) with \\(V = 1/k\\). This formalizes the Quantity Theory of Money (QTM) – assuming stable velocity (or cash-holding ratio \\(k\\)) and exogenous output, the money supply governs the nominal GDP and price level[15][17]. Excess money supply, given output, bids up prices until money market equilibrium is restored.\nContemporary Relevance: The classical theory provides a crucial baseline for thinking about inflation and monetary policy. It correctly predicts that countries with persistently rapid money growth (relative to output) experience high inflation[37]. Monetarist policies in the 1970s–80s were inspired by this theory and had success in curbing inflation by restraining money growth[21]. Even today, surges in the money supply (e.g. during the COVID-19 crisis) are closely watched for inflationary impact[25].\nLimitations: In practice, the strict classical dichotomy breaks down in the short run. Because of sticky prices, variable velocity, and financial complexities, money is not always neutral in the short-to-medium term. Velocity can shift due to changes in interest rates or public confidence, weakening the link between money and prices[28][32]. Accordingly, modern central banks target inflation via interest rates and other tools rather than fixing the money supply growth alone. The classical theory is best viewed as a long-run anchor – in the long run, excessive money creation will cause inflation – but with the understanding that short-run dynamics can deviate from the classical predictions.\n\n\n\nAtkinson, T. and Mau, R.

    "text": "The classical theory of money is an approach in macroeconomics asserting that money primarily influences nominal variables (prices, wages) and has negligible effect on real economic activity (output, employment) in the long run. Classical economists often say “money is a veil”, meaning that the system of money prices may obscure real economic relationships, but in reality the underlying real economy is unchanged by the quantity of money in circulation[1]. This theory, rooted in the 19th-century Walrasian general equilibrium framework and the early 20th-century Quantity Theory of Money, underpins the view that sustained changes in the money supply lead to proportional changes in the price level, with real variables determined by real factors like technology and preferences. In this reading, we outline the classical model of a monetary economy and its key implications – the Walrasian system of general equilibrium, the classical dichotomy between real and monetary sectors, the neutrality of money, the Cambridge equation of exchange, and the Quantity Theory of Money (QTM) – and discuss how these ideas hold up with contemporary examples. We also examine the limitations of the classical view, including situations (such as short-run economic fluctuations or extreme policy environments) where money may not be neutral and why modern economists and central banks have nuanced this theory.",

    "text": "Classical theory builds on the Walrasian general equilibrium model of a barter economy (named after Léon Walras, 1834–1910, a pioneer of mathematical economics). In a Walrasian system, all markets for goods and services simultaneously clear through price adjustment. Formally, it consists of a set of market-clearing conditions (one for each good or factor) and a corresponding set of relative prices that adjust to equate supply and demand in every market[2]. Importantly, only relative prices matter in this system – prices are expressed in terms of one another (for instance, how many units of good A trade for one unit of good B). One good can be chosen as a numéraire (unit of account) to price all other goods, fixing the scale for relative prices.\nBecause all prices in Walrasian equilibrium are determined only up to a common scale, the model exhibits homogeneity: if all prices were doubled (or halved), the real allocations of goods would remain the same. This implies that in a purely real economy without money, the absolute price level is indeterminate – there is no unique solution for “the” price level, only for relative prices. In other words, the Walrasian model determines what and how much gets produced and consumed (real output and relative price ratios), but not the overall monetary value of those goods. Walras’ Law holds that if all but one markets are in equilibrium, the last market must also clear (excess supply in one market must be matched by excess demand in at least one other), ensuring consistency of the general equilibrium[3][4].\nIn this frictionless, barter-style economy, real variables – such as real output, the allocation of goods, and relative prices – are determined entirely by real factors (preferences, endowments, technology) without any reference to the money supply. This is the foundation of the classical idea that money is nonessential in determining real economic outcomes. However, to analyze an economy with money (a monetary economy), we need to introduce money into the Walrasian system in a way that pins down the general price level.",

    "text": "The introduction of money into the model leads to what is known as the classical dichotomy – a strict separation between the determination of real variables and nominal variables. According to the classical dichotomy, real variables (such as real GDP, real consumption, employment, and relative prices of goods) are determined independently of nominal variables (such as the absolute price level, inflation rate, and nominal money supply)[5]. In practical terms, one can first solve for the real equilibrium of the economy (the allocation of resources and relative prices as if it were a barter economy), and then determine the nominal price level by considering the money market. The presence of money serves only to convert the barter terms of trade into monetary terms; it does not alter the underlying real equilibrium.\nThis dichotomy reflects the notion that money is neutral in its effect on the real economy, an idea we explore more below. In the classical view, money’s sole function in general equilibrium is to determine the units in which prices are quoted – essentially acting as a unit of account and medium of exchange without changing real outcomes. Walras’s model extended to include money treats money as an additional “good” for which supply and demand must equilibrate, but crucially, changes in the supply of money do not affect the equilibrium quantities of other goods or relative prices (they only affect absolute nominal prices). The system of equations describing the economy can thus be partitioned into a real subsystem and a monetary subsystem, with minimal feedback from the monetary side to the real side – this is the essence of the classical dichotomy[5].\nHistorically, classical economists like David Hume illustrated the dichotomy with thought experiments: if overnight every person’s stock of money doubled, people would initially feel wealthier and try to spend more, but with no change in the real quantity of goods, prices would soon double as well. Ultimately, the economy would be in the same real state as before, just with all prices (and monetary values) scaled up. The real output, employment, and relative prices would be unchanged – only the monetary values differ. This parable encapsulates the classical dichotomy by showing that real wealth hasn’t changed even though nominal money holdings did.",

    "text": "From the classical dichotomy stems the principle of the neutrality of money. Money is said to be neutral if changes in the stock of money have no effect on real economic variables (like real output or the real interest rate), affecting only nominal variables (like the price level or nominal incomes). In the classical theory, with flexible prices and wages, money is neutral even in the short run. A change in the money supply – whether through gold discoveries in a classical gold standard economy or open-market operations by a central bank – will proportionally change all money prices but leave real production and consumption decisions unaltered[6].\nLong-run monetary neutrality is a core implication: for example, a permanent doubling of the money supply is predicted to eventually lead to a doubling of the price level (a 100% inflation), with real GDP, employment, and real interest rates returning to their original levels[7]. In classical thought, this adjustment happens relatively quickly as prices are fully flexible. All agents understand that only nominal values have changed, so there is no lasting effect on output or other real magnitudes.\nHow does this adjustment occur? We can think in terms of supply and demand for money. Suppose the economy’s real output \\(Y\\) and money demand behavior are initially given, and the central bank unexpectedly doubles the money supply (\\(M\\)). At the old price level \\(P_0\\), there is now excess supply of money – people have more money than they desire to hold relative to goods. They will try to get rid of the excess money balances by increasing spending on goods and services (or purchasing assets). This creates an excess demand for goods (equivalently, an excess demand for all non-money assets) by Walras’ Law[8]. With more money chasing the same amount of goods, prices begin to rise. Higher prices reduce the real purchasing power of the excess money, thereby reducing the excess money balances. The price level will continue to rise until the real value of the money supply \\(M/P\\) has increased enough that people are willing to hold the entire new money supply. At the new equilibrium, the price level \\(P_1\\) will be higher (in fact, roughly double \\(P_0\\) in this scenario), such that the ratio \\(M/P\\) is restored to the original real money demand. Real variables (the quantity of goods produced and consumed) remain the same, but all nominal prices have doubled. Essentially, the equilibrium shifts from \\((M_0, P_0)\\) to \\((M_1, P_1)\\), with \\(M_1 = 2 M_0\\) and \\(P_1 \\approx 2 P_0\\), so that the real money supply \\(M_1/P_1\\) equals the original \\(M_0/P_0\\).\nTo visualize money neutrality, consider a simple money market diagram (value of money on the vertical axis and quantity of money on the horizontal axis). The demand for money is downward sloping in terms of the value of money (i.e. \\(1/P\\)) – at higher price levels (lower \\(1/P\\)), people need to hold more nominal money for transactions, so the demand for nominal balances increases as \\(1/P\\) falls. The supply of money is fixed exogenously by the central bank (a vertical line at the given \\(M\\)). Equilibrium occurs where money supply equals money demand, determining the equilibrium \\(1/P\\). Now, if the money supply increases (the vertical line shifts to the right), the intersection with the demand curve moves downward – the equilibrium value of money \\(1/P\\) falls, which means the price level \\(P\\) rises in proportion to the increase in \\(M\\). The following figure illustrates this outcome:\nIllustration: Equilibrium in the money market determines the value of money (the inverse of the price level). The demand for money (\\(D_M\\)) is downward sloping in terms of \\(1/P\\), and the money supply (\\(S_M\\)) is vertical (fixed by policy). An increase in the money supply from \\(M_0\\) to \\(M_1\\) shifts the supply curve rightward, causing the equilibrium value of money to drop from \\(1/P_0\\) to \\(1/P_1\\) – equivalently, the price level \\(P\\) rises. In classical theory, real output (\\(Y\\)) and money demand parameters are unchanged, so this change in \\(P\\) leaves real variables unaffected.[9]\nIn the classical long-run perspective, empirical evidence does show that countries with persistently higher money growth tend to have higher inflation, consistent with money neutrality in the long term. Cross-country studies find a close one-to-one relationship between the rate of money growth (in excess of real GDP growth) and the inflation rate in the long run[10]. For example, during episodes of hyperinflation, excessive money creation clearly leads to soaring prices: Zimbabwe’s central bank, by printing money in the 2000s, contributed to one of the worst hyperinflations on record – at its peak in 2008, prices in Zimbabwe were estimated to be rising at an astronomical rate of 500 billion percent per year[11]. Such extreme cases demonstrate that pouring huge amounts of money into an economy with limited output will drastically reduce money’s value (raise the price level). In more moderate circumstances too, “if the money supply grows too big relative to the size of an economy, the unit value of the currency diminishes – its purchasing power falls and prices rise”[12], which is precisely the quantity theory prediction.\nIt should be noted, however, that classical theory abstracts from short-run frictions. In reality, prices and wages may not adjust immediately (they can be sticky in the short run), so a sudden increase in the money supply might temporarily boost real activity – a possibility acknowledged even by later monetarist economists[13]. The classical model, though, assumes away these short-run rigidities, focusing on the ultimate outcome after prices have fully adjusted. In that full-adjustment scenario, money is neutral: aside from the price level and other nominal values, nothing real has changed.",

    "text": "To determine the price level in a monetary economy, classical economists augmented the Walrasian real system with an equation describing money demand – famously formulated by the Cambridge school of economists (Alfred Marshall, A.C. Pigou, and even a young John Maynard Keynes) in the early 1900s. The Cambridge equation (or cash-balance equation) focuses on the demand for money as a proportion of income. It can be expressed as:\nwhere \\(M^d\\) is the desired nominal money holdings (money demand), \\(P\\) is the general price level, \\(Y\\) is real national income (real output), and \\(k\\) is a parameter representing the fraction of nominal income that people wish to hold in the form of money (their cash holding ratio). In equilibrium, we assume the money market clears, so the supply of money \\(M\\) equals money demand \\(M^d\\). Thus, the Cambridge equilibrium condition is:\nThis simple equation embodies the idea that people plan to hold a certain proportion \\(k\\) of their income in cash balances for convenience and safety. The value of \\(k\\) reflects factors like payment habits, financial technology, and preferences for liquidity – for example, if people keep one month’s worth of income as cash on average, \\(k\\) might be about \\(1/12 \\approx 0.08\\). The velocity of money \\(V\\) is the inverse of this cash-balance ratio: . Velocity \\(V\\) measures how many times per period the average unit of currency is spent on final goods and services (i.e. how quickly money circulates). If \\(k=0.1\\), then \\(V=10\\), meaning each dollar (or pound, etc.) is used to purchase 10 dollars’ worth of output per period on average.\nThe Cambridge equation can be rewritten to make the price level the subject:\nThis tells us that for a given real output \\(Y\\) and given money demand parameter \\(k\\), the price level \\(P\\) adjusts in proportion to the money supply \\(M\\). In other words, the quantity of money in circulation relative to the economy’s output (adjusted by how much money people want to hold) determines the price level. If the money supply doubles, then unless there is a change in \\(Y\\) or \\(k\\), the price level must double to maintain the equality \\(M = k P Y\\). In the classical model, \\(Y\\) is determined by real factors (and in the long run by things like technology and resources), and \\(k\\) is assumed to be stable (or exogenously given by institutions and preferences). Therefore, any change in \\(M\\) translates to an proportional change in \\(P\\). This Cambridge equation thus fills the gap in the Walrasian system: whereas the Walrasian real equilibrium couldn’t pin down the absolute level of prices, adding the money market equilibrium condition (\\(M\\) supply equals \\(M^d = kPY\\) demand) yields a solution for the nominal price level[14]. The classical dichotomy is evident here – the real variable \\(Y\\) is solved elsewhere, and once \\(Y\\) is known, the nominal variable \\(P\\) adjusts to satisfy the money equation given \\(M\\).\nIt’s worth noting that the Cambridge cash-balance approach is just a different perspective on the quantity theory of money, emphasizing money demand instead of supply. Unlike the “transactions” version of the quantity theory (associated with American economist Irving Fisher, discussed next), which treats velocity as given and focuses on the flow of money spending, the Cambridge equation arises from thinking about how much of their income people wish to hold in monetary form at any time. Both approaches, however, arrive at a similar conclusion: a linkage between the money supply and nominal income. Indeed, if we take the Cambridge equation and multiply both sides by \\(V = 1/k\\), we get \\(M \\cdot V = P \\cdot Y\\). Thus the Cambridge equation is mathematically equivalent to the more famous equation of exchange, as long as we identify \\(V = 1/k\\)[15]. The two formulations differ subtly in interpretation – the classical (Fisherian) view tends to treat \\(V\\) as a constant technical parameter and money as only a medium of exchange, whereas the Cambridge view gives \\(k\\) (hence \\(V\\)) a behavioral interpretation and recognizes money’s role as a store of value that people may desire to hold. But in the strict classical theory, \\(k\\) (and hence \\(V\\)) was taken to be fairly stable in the short run, so the distinction did not undermine the overall prediction.",

    "text": "The Quantity Theory of Money is the centerpiece of classical monetary theory. It is often summarized by the equation of exchange:\nHere \\(M\\) is the money supply, \\(V\\) is the velocity of money, \\(P\\) is the price level, and \\(Y\\) is real output (often \\(Y\\) is taken to be real GDP for the whole economy). This equation is an identity – it defines velocity \\(V\\) as the ratio of nominal GDP (\\(P \\times Y\\)) to the money stock \\(M\\). It says that the total amount of money multiplied by the number of times each unit of money is used to buy goods (velocity) equals the total monetary value of goods purchased (\\(P \\times Y\\)) in the economy. As an accounting statement, this always holds true by construction in any given period.\nThe equation of exchange becomes a powerful theory (the QTM) with one key additional assumption: velocity \\(V\\) is constant (or at least predictable), and independent of other variables, and real output \\(Y\\) is determined by non-monetary factors (e.g. resources and technology, as in the Walrasian real system). Under these assumptions, any change in \\(M\\) must be reflected primarily in \\(P\\). In growth rate form, the quantity theory predicts that the inflation rate (growth of \\(P\\)) will equal the growth rate of money minus the growth rate of real output (since \\(V\\) is constant)[16]. For example, if the money supply grows 5% per year and real GDP grows 2% per year, QTM would predict roughly 3% annual inflation in the long run (5% – 2% = 3%). In short, the Quantity Theory of Money posits a direct, proportional relationship between the money supply and the price level, when other factors are held constant[17]. It is “one of the oldest hypotheses in economics,” linking excessive money growth to inflation[18][19].\nA classical quantity theorist typically assumes that \\(V\\) is stable due to institutions or habits (for instance, people might get paid monthly and pay bills monthly, implying a regular turnover of money). Empirically, velocity does change over time, but in early 20th century economies it was often sufficiently stable in the short run that treating it as roughly constant was not a bad approximation[20]. Meanwhile, \\(Y\\) in the long run is determined by labor, capital, technology, etc., not by the money supply. Therefore, increases in \\(M\\) lead to proportionate increases in \\(P\\). This formalizes the intuition behind money neutrality. As an IMF explainer succinctly put it, “if the money supply grows too big relative to the size of an economy, the unit value of the currency diminishes – its purchasing power falls and prices rise”[12]. The Quantity Theory thus provides a mechanism for how inflation can be controlled by controlling money growth. It underlies the famous maxim by Milton Friedman (a leading 20th-century monetarist) that “inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.”\nHistorical example: The QTM was vividly demonstrated during the Great Inflation of the 1970s. In the United States and United Kingdom, rapid growth of the money supply was accompanied by surging prices. Monetarist economists, reviving the classical QTM, argued that to bring down inflation, central banks needed to restrain money growth. Indeed, in 1979 the U.S. Federal Reserve under Paul Volcker dramatically changed policy to target the money supply growth rate. By limiting money growth, the Fed was able to squeeze inflation out of the system by the early 1980s, albeit at the cost of a recession[21]. Similarly, the U.K. adopted monetarist policies under Margaret Thatcher. These policy episodes were inspired directly by QTM logic – essentially applying classical theory to practice – and they lend support to the long-run link between money and prices. Many countries thereafter maintained a focus on low money growth to keep inflation low (until the practice of inflation targeting eventually replaced direct money targets, as discussed later).\nAnother dramatic example is the relationship between money growth and hyperinflation. We mentioned Zimbabwe’s hyperinflation; similarly, classic case studies like the Weimar German hyperinflation of 1923 show a clear QTM pattern. In Weimar Germany, the government massively increased the paper money supply to finance expenses, and the price level exploded in proportion, to the point where money became nearly worthless. Such episodes reinforce that, when taken to extremes, money growth and inflation go hand-in-hand.\nIt’s important to realize that the Quantity Theory of Money (QTM), as used in classical theory, is more than just the identity \\(MV=PY\\). It is the hypothesis that causality runs from left to right: the money supply is exogenous (determined by the central bank or gold supply) and is the primary driver of nominal GDP and the price level in the long run, with velocity and real GDP growth taken as given. The QTM assumes long-run neutrality (money only affects \\(P\\)) and often also assumes dichotomy (that real output \\(Y\\) is determined independently). Under these conditions, controlling inflation is as simple as controlling money supply growth. Monetarist economists in the 20th century extended this classical theory, asserting that a stable money growth rule would lead to stable prices[22][23]. They pointed to statistical correlations between money and prices, and argued, for example, that the Great Depression of the 1930s in the U.S. was largely due to a sharp contraction of the money stock (a thesis advanced by Friedman and Schwartz in A Monetary History of the United States[24]).\nThe QTM has seen a resurgence in debate in recent years. After the Global Financial Crisis of 2007–09, central banks injected unprecedented amounts of money into economies (through quantitative easing), yet inflation in many advanced economies remained subdued for a long time in the 2010s. This led some to question whether the classical quantity relation had broken down, as velocity appeared to decline. However, following the COVID-19 pandemic, money growth spiked again (for example, U.S. M2 money supply grew over 25% year-on-year at one point in 2020), and by 2021–2022 inflation jumped to multi-decade highs. Analysts noted that a simple quantity-theoretic linkage between money and inflation seemed to reassert itself during this period[25]. In fact, a basic model using money growth did successfully signal the rise of inflation post-2020, even though it had failed to predict inflation in the prior two decades of low inflation[26][16]. This mixed record underscores that the QTM holds well under some circumstances (especially when there are large swings in money growth and when the economy is near full capacity), but can be less reliable in others – a point we now examine as we discuss the limitations of the classical view.",

    "text": "While the classical theory of money provides a useful benchmark and is largely borne out in the long run, economists have long identified several limitations and caveats to its applicability. In practice, the strict classical dichotomy and money neutrality do not always hold, especially in the short run or under certain conditions. Here are some key limitations and challenges to the classical view:\nShort-Run Non-Neutrality and Price Stickiness: The classical model assumes fully flexible prices and wages that instantaneously clear markets. In reality, many prices (e.g. wages in contracts, or prices set by firms) adjust slowly. In the presence of such sticky prices, changes in the money supply can have short-term real effects. This was a central insight of John Maynard Keynes and later Keynesian economics: if the money supply increases, in the short run it may lower interest rates and stimulate investment and consumption, thus increasing real output and employment – contrary to neutrality. Only over time, as prices gradually adjust, will the full effect be reflected in the price level. Keynesians argue that during recessions or periods of slack, output is demand-determined, and an increase in money (and thus demand) can raise output rather than prices. The classical dichotomy is thus violated in the short run: real and nominal variables are intertwined. Modern empirical research confirms that money is not neutral in the short term – for instance, expansionary monetary policy often boosts real GDP for a couple of years before inflation catches up. Even monetarist economists accept the idea of short-run monetary nonneutrality due to lags in price adjustment[13]. The long-run neutrality may still hold, but the journey matters for economic fluctuations.\nUnstable Velocity and Money Demand: The classical QTM assumes velocity (\\(V\\)) or the Cambridge \\(k\\) is fixed (or at least exogenous and stable). In reality, velocity can and does change due to various factors – interest rates, financial innovation, payment technologies, and economic uncertainty can all affect how much money people want to hold relative to income. Keynes, in his critique of the classical theory, introduced the idea of speculative demand for money (part of his liquidity preference theory), suggesting that \\(k\\) is not a constant but depends on the interest rate: when interest rates are low, people are less incentivized to hold bonds and more content holding money, so money demand rises (velocity falls), and vice versa. He also noted that expectations of deflation or financial turmoil can make people hoard cash (increasing \\(k\\) dramatically). In symbolic form, Keynesians might express money demand as \\(M^d = k(i) \\, P \\, Y\\), where \\(k\\) is a function of the nominal interest rate \\(i\\) (and perhaps other variables like expectations of inflation)[27]. This view implies that velocity is endogenous and can vary widely – which undermines the simple classical QTM prediction. Indeed, Keynesians attach little or no significance to a rigid quantity theory rule precisely because velocity is inherently unstable[28]. Empirical history vindicates this concern: for example, in the 1980s, financial deregulation and innovation in banking altered the stability of money demand in the US and UK, causing velocity of traditional aggregates (like \\(M1\\) or \\(M2\\)) to shift unpredictably. During the 1990s and 2000s, the rise of credit cards, money market funds, and later digital payment platforms continued to change money holding patterns. Central banks found that targeting a money supply growth rate (as suggested by monetarism) became unreliable because the relationship between money, output, and prices was weakening – the money demand function was shifting. This is one reason why central banks moved away from strict money supply targets to interest rate targets and inflation targeting frameworks by the 1990s: the link between measured money supply and inflation became harder to discern in real time[29][30].\nEmpirical Variability in the Money-Inflation Relationship: The long-run correlation between money growth and inflation is strong across broad samples and extreme cases, but over shorter horizons and moderate inflation environments the relationship can be obscured by other factors. Studies have found that when inflation is low and stable, money growth often does not closely predict inflation – velocity may fluctuate or other forces (like supply/demand shocks) dominate short-run inflation dynamics[31]. For instance, in the two decades before the 2020s, many advanced economies saw relatively high growth in central bank money (due to quantitative easing) but inflation remained low, as much of the new money was effectively stored in banks as excess reserves or was offset by declines in money velocity. A Dallas Fed analysis noted that a simple money-growth-based model would have badly under-predicted or over-predicted inflation in those years, reflecting an unstable relationship between money and inflation in environments where inflation expectations are anchored[32]. This does not invalidate the QTM in the long run, but it shows that the short-to-medium run link can loosen. When the regime changes – as in 2021 when inflation re-emerged – the link appeared to strengthen again, reminding us that context matters[17][33]. The BIS (Bank for International Settlements) recently reported that money growth tends to be a more reliable indicator of inflation during high-inflation regimes than in low-inflation regimes[31]. In summary, the QTM’s assumption of a stable velocity is more of a conditional truth; velocity can be volatile, and policy must take that into account.\nDefinition of Money and Financial Innovation: Classical theory assumes a clear definition of “money” – often implicitly referring to currency or a narrow aggregate. In practice, money comes in different forms (cash, checking deposits, savings accounts, money market funds, etc.), and the boundary between money and other financial assets can shift. If people move funds between money and near-money assets, the effective money supply for transactions might change even if base money doesn’t, affecting velocity calculations. Over the years, definitions like \\(M1\\), \\(M2\\), \\(M3\\) were created, and their velocities behaved differently. The classical story is simplified and doesn’t fully capture these complexities of a modern credit-based monetary system where commercial banks create money (via lending) and central bank control is mostly indirect. It turned out to be challenging to find a monetary aggregate that has both a stable velocity and strong link to inflation in real time. This is another reason why central banks in practice target interest rates rather than the money supply nowadays – they can more directly influence economic conditions through rates, whereas controlling money growth alone proved insufficient when velocity shifted. The classical theory’s implications remain true in the long run (too much broad money growth will eventually cause inflation), but short-run monetary policy must deal with uncertainty in money demand.\nEconomic Conditions (Liquidity Traps and Confidence): In some extreme situations, changes in the money supply may have little effect on either prices or output – a situation known as a liquidity trap. This occurs, for example, when interest rates are near zero and investors have essentially infinite demand for liquidity (money) at that rate. In a liquidity trap (as during the Great Depression or Japan in the 1990s or globally in the late 2000s), increasing the money supply might simply lead to people holding more cash (an increase in \\(k\\)) with no increase in spending – thus neither output nor prices rise much. This scenario is outside the classical theory, which assumes away such pathological cases. It required Keynesian analysis to explain: when confidence is shattered and interest rates are at the lower bound, the classical dichotomy breaks down completely – money is non-neutral even in potentially long periods because prices may even fall (deflation) despite monetary expansion. Fortunately, such traps are rare, but the possibility highlights that the neutrality of money is not a universal law but a conditional outcome.\nIntegration with Real Finance and Interest Rates: The classical theory in its pure form abstracts from how money interacts with interest rates and asset markets. In reality, a change in the money supply can affect interest rates (at least in the short run before prices adjust), which in turn can affect investment and consumption. The classical model assumed the loanable funds market adjusts interest rates based on saving and investment, independent of the money supply. However, if the central bank injects money, it may temporarily lower interest rates (if we hold prices fixed in the very short run), causing real effects – this is essentially the Keynesian transmission mechanism. Modern New Classical and New Keynesian models have incorporated money or monetary policy into a broader framework with interest rate rules and expectations, something the simplistic classical model does not do.\nContemporary challenges – Digital Currencies: A very modern consideration is how digital currencies and fintech innovations affect the classical theory. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, or central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), represent new forms of money (or quasi-money). Do they change the quantity theory? So far, there is no evidence that they overturn basic monetary principles – the classical logic would still apply to an economy’s overall money supply broadly defined. For instance, one empirical study found “no change in velocity or the money multiplier after the rise of cryptocurrencies”, suggesting that the advent of crypto has not materially altered aggregate money demand or the effectiveness of monetary policy[34]. However, digital innovations can affect \\(k\\) in the Cambridge equation by making transactions easier (potentially raising velocity) or introducing alternative assets that serve some functions of money. Central banks are closely watching these developments. The consensus is that while the forms of money are evolving, the fundamental constraint – that if too much liquidity chases too few goods, the value of money will drop – remains as true as ever. Digital currencies might change how we measure and control the money supply, but they do not negate the classical long-run link between money and prices.\nIn light of these limitations, modern macroeconomists view the classical theory of money as a long-run benchmark rather than a complete description for all time horizons. It offers a valid intuition for why sustained money growth leads to inflation (and conversely, why controlling money growth can stabilize prices). However, for short-run analysis and policy design, we use more elaborate frameworks that account for price stickiness, expectations, and financial frictions (for example, the IS-LM model in Keynesian tradition or New Keynesian dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models). These frameworks relax the classical dichotomy – allowing monetary policy to have real effects in the short run – while typically still embedding long-run neutrality of money as a special case. Central banks today generally target inflation directly (often through interest-rate policy) rather than the money supply, implicitly acknowledging that velocity is unstable in the short run. Yet, the spirit of the quantity theory survives: central bankers recognize that excessive money creation will ultimately be inflationary[35], and keeping inflation low and stable in the long run requires not letting money grow far out of line with the economy’s capacity to produce goods and services.",

    "text": "Walrasian Foundations: The classical theory is built on a Walrasian general equilibrium of the real economy, where flexible prices ensure all markets clear. In a barter setting, only relative prices are determined; a purely real model cannot pin down the absolute price level[2].\nMoney as a Veil: Introducing money separates real and nominal variables. The classical dichotomy holds that real economic outcomes (output, relative prices, real interest rates) are determined by real factors, independent of the money supply[5]. Money provides a unit of account and medium of exchange but is a “veil” over the real economy – changing the money supply only changes nominal prices, not the real allocation of resources[1].\nNeutrality of Money: In the classical view, money is neutral in both the long run and (in the absence of frictions) the short run. A change in the money supply leads to an equal proportional change in the price level and other nominal values, leaving real GDP, employment, and real interest rates unaffected[6]. This implies that inflation is fundamentally a monetary phenomenon in the long term. Historical episodes of high inflation underscore this one-to-one link between money growth and prices[36][11].\nCambridge Equation and QTM: The classical theory determines the price level via the Cambridge cash-balance equation \\(M = kPY\\), which is equivalent to the quantity equation \\(MV = PY\\) with \\(V = 1/k\\). This formalizes the Quantity Theory of Money (QTM) – assuming stable velocity (or cash-holding ratio \\(k\\)) and exogenous output, the money supply governs the nominal GDP and price level[15][17]. Excess money supply, given output, bids up prices until money market equilibrium is restored.\nContemporary Relevance: The classical theory provides a crucial baseline for thinking about inflation and monetary policy. It correctly predicts that countries with persistently rapid money growth (relative to output) experience high inflation[37]. Monetarist policies in the 1970s–80s were inspired by this theory and had success in curbing inflation by restraining money growth[21]. Even today, surges in the money supply (e.g. during the COVID-19 crisis) are closely watched for inflationary impact[25].\nLimitations: In practice, the strict classical dichotomy breaks down in the short run. Because of sticky prices, variable velocity, and financial complexities, money is not always neutral in the short-to-medium term. Velocity can shift due to changes in interest rates or public confidence, weakening the link between money and prices[28][32]. Accordingly, modern central banks target inflation via interest rates and other tools rather than fixing the money supply growth alone. The classical theory is best viewed as a long-run anchor – in the long run, excessive money creation will cause inflation – but with the understanding that short-run dynamics can deviate from the classical predictions.",

Unlike other markets where disequilibrium results in changes in the nominal price of the item in question, this is not possible in the market for money.\n(b) The supply of money is also unresponsive, as money is exogenously supplied by a sovereign authority (a Central Bank in the modern context).\n(c) There are no close substitutes for money in terms of the liquidity services that it provides (although this is less true today than it was in Keynes’ time).\nIs this a problem?\nThis is not always a problem. Precisely because money is so central in both asset and goods markets, an exogenous increase in the demand for money can lead to collective adjustments in these markets that restore macroeconomic equilibrium.\nAn increase in the demand for money can lead to: - An increase in the interest rate, which induces a shift back from money to interest-bearing assets, and/or - A decrease in the price level, which induces an increase in the demand for goods (collectively) and thus a decrease in the demand for money via Walras’ Law.\nWhen it becomes a problem:\nThese normal adjustment mechanisms fail to work if the economy is caught in a liquidity trap. In such a situation, economic agents are willing to hold unlimited amounts of money due to its perceived security. Thus neither can the interest rate rise in a liquidity trap, nor can falling prices induce a greater demand for goods."

    "text": "Question 3: The Liquidity Trap\nQuestion: Explain in words alone (without using diagrams) how the normal adjustment mechanisms that allow equilibrium to be restored following an increase in the demand for money, do not work if the economy is in a liquidity trap.\n\nIndicative Answer\nThe liquidity trap is characterised by a situation in which the economy is suffering from low levels of output as well as low interest rates. In such a situation, Keynes argued that economic agents could become unwilling to part with their money (beyond some minimum needed to cover essentials) in exchange either for goods or for other assets. This situation is also known as absolute liquidity preference.\nAt the individual level, absolute liquidity preference can be justified as a result of agents’ uncertainty and pessimism about the future state of the economy. However, when all agents indulge this absolute liquidity preference, the result is precisely the collapse of aggregate demand—and with it economic activity—that agents fear in the first place.\nWhy normal price adjustments fail:\nIn normal times, an increase in the demand for money might temporarily lead to a decrease in the collective demand for goods at the going market price in each goods market. This would trigger competition between goods’ suppliers in each market, leading to a decrease in each good’s price, and therefore of the overall price level. This falling price level would induce greater spending on goods—so long as the economy was not in a liquidity trap (i.e., agents were not exhibiting absolute liquidity preference).\nIn a liquidity trap, however, falling prices do not induce greater spending precisely because the desire to hoard money is unlimited.\nWhy normal interest rate adjustments fail:\nSimilarly, because money is also a store of value that competes with interest-bearing stores of value in agents’ portfolios, an increase in the demand for money would, in normal times, lead to a collective decrease in the demand for interest-bearing assets. Competition amongst the issuers of such assets would result in a higher interest rate, inducing a shift back by savers into holding such assets and eliminating the excess demand for money—so long as the latter is not due to a desire to hoard unlimited amounts of money.\nIn a liquidity trap, however, precisely because the desire to hoard money is unlimited, this mechanism also ceases to work."

    "title": "Keynes’s Theory of Money",
    "section": "",
    "text": "John Maynard Keynes revolutionized monetary economics by examining the roles money plays in the economy and their macroeconomic implications. Writing during the Great Depression, Keynes challenged the classical view that money is merely a neutral medium of exchange or “veil” that affects only prices but not real output or employment. In classical theory, the economy was thought to naturally gravitate to full employment equilibrium via flexible prices (the classical dichotomy), implying money had no real effects in the long run. Keynes, however, argued that in a monetary economy – where money actively influences decisions – there is no automatic guarantee of full employment. He developed a theory of liquidity preference and money demand that highlights how money can matter in both the short run and long run. This chapter examines Keynes’s theory of money demand (transactions, precautionary, and speculative motives), his concept of the liquidity trap, and the resulting disequilibrium analysis using the IS-LM model. We also contrast the neutrality of money in classical theory with Keynes’s view of non-neutrality, and discuss the Pigou effect as a classical critique of Keynes. Throughout, we integrate historical and contemporary examples – from Japan’s 1990s stagnation to post-2008 low interest environments in the US, UK, and Eurozone – to illustrate these concepts in practice.\n\n\n\n\n\nKeynes’s key analytical move is to treat the money market as exceptional. In many markets, an excess demand triggers adjustment through at least three channels: (i) the good’s own price rises, (ii) supply expands, and (iii) agents substitute toward close substitutes. Keynes argued that these equilibrating forces are weak or absent for money in its role as a pure medium of exchange.\n\n\n\nKeynes highlighted three features of the money market that make it hard to clear through “normal” market mechanisms:\n\nThe nominal price of money is unresponsive to disequilibrium — Money has a face value. Unlike ordinary goods, an excess demand for money does not “bid up” the nominal value of money in the same way that excess demand for apples bids up apple prices.\nSupply is unresponsive because the money stock is exogenously determined — The stock of money is set by the monetary authority rather than being produced in response to higher “money prices”.\nThere are no close substitutes as media of exchange — Even if near-money instruments exist today, Keynes’s emphasis is that money’s payment finality and transactional acceptability are difficult to replicate fully. This matters when confidence collapses: agents may prefer money to specific private liabilities (bank deposits, firm credits) perceived as risky.\n\n\n\n\nIn modern financial systems, some substitutes exist (money market funds, repos, short-maturity government bills). However, Keynes’s core point survives: in stress episodes, investors demand the most liquid and safest instrument, and the system can experience a shortage of safe and liquid assets. This is consistent with observed “flight-to-quality” and “flight-to-liquidity” dynamics in financial crises.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a non-monetary (or effectively barter) economy, an increase in saving typically reallocates demand rather than destroying it. Classical reasoning holds: higher saving means more purchases of durable goods or more lending to firms for investment, shifting production across sectors but leaving aggregate employment roughly unchanged.\nIn a monetary economy, however, higher desired saving can take the form of hoarding money (increasing money demand) rather than purchasing goods or financing investment. When this occurs:\n\nOverall demand for goods falls,\nDemand for money rises,\nLabour demand falls,\nUnemployment emerges.\n\n\n\n\nA crucial insight from the lecture notes: in a monetary economy, Walras’ Law no longer implies Say’s Law. An excess demand for money can co-exist with an excess supply of goods. When agents attempt to rebuild liquidity positions, desired spending falls below output. This is Keynes’s fundamental explanation for why unemployment can be an equilibrium outcome in a monetary economy: the “missing demand” is not redirected automatically into other goods; it can be redirected into money balances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeynes acknowledges that money-market disequilibrium can in principle be eliminated via adjustment in other markets, even if money’s own “price” does not move:\n\nInterest rate adjustment: If returns on alternative assets rise, agents substitute away from money; money demand falls.\nPrice-level adjustment: If goods prices fall, real balances \\(M/P\\) rise and goods demand may increase; money demand (as a share of expenditure) falls.\n\nThis is crucial: Keynes is not claiming the money market is always permanently out of equilibrium. He is claiming that adjustment can be slow, incomplete, or blocked—especially when prices are sticky and when interest rates approach a floor.\n\n\n\nThe key point is that adjustment mechanisms “might” work but do not necessarily “will” work because of price stickiness. Equilibrating adjustments may take significant time. Modern macroeconomic evidence is consistent with the idea that wages and prices (especially nominal wages and administered prices) adjust sluggishly, so output and employment take the hit in the interim.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClassical economists view interest as the reward for saving (deferring consumption) and determine it via supply and demand for loanable funds:\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n\nWarning: package 'ggplot2' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\nCode\n# Data\nlf &lt;- seq(0, 10, length.out = 100)\nS &lt;- 2 + 0.5 * lf  # Saving supply\nI &lt;- 7 - 0.5 * lf  # Investment demand\n\n# Equilibrium\neq_lf &lt;- 5\neq_i &lt;- 4.5\n\n# Plot\nggplot() +\n  geom_line(aes(x = lf, y = S, color = \"S (Saving supply)\"), linewidth = 1) +\n  geom_line(aes(x = lf, y = I, color = \"I (Investment demand)\"), linewidth = 1) +\n  annotate(\"point\", x = eq_lf, y = eq_i, size = 3) +\n  geom_segment(aes(x = eq_lf, xend = eq_lf, y = 0, yend = eq_i), linetype = \"dashed\", alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_segment(aes(x = 0, xend = eq_lf, y = eq_i, yend = eq_i), linetype = \"dashed\", alpha = 0.5) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = eq_lf + 0.5, y = eq_i, label = \"Equilibrium\\n(i*)\", size = 3.5) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"S (Saving supply)\" = \"blue\", \"I (Investment demand)\" = \"red\")) +\n  labs(x = \"Loanable Funds\", y = \"Interest Rate (i)\", \n       title = \"Classical Loanable Funds Market\", color = \"\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"top\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Classical Theory of Interest (Loanable Funds Market)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeynes reframes interest as the reward for holding wealth in illiquid form rather than liquid form. Thus:\n\nA fall in \\(i\\) increases money demand (agents prefer liquidity over bonds),\nMoney demand and money supply jointly determine \\(i\\),\nHigher income shifts money demand right and raises \\(i\\) (via higher transactions demand).\n\nKeynes also notes the reconciliation with the classical view via a system approach (IS–LM), as later formalized by Hicks.\nClassical economists explained interest rate determination through the loanable funds market, where the interest rate adjusts to equate saving and investment. In that view (often illustrated by a supply-of-savings and demand-for-investment diagram), the interest rate is the price of funds: households’ willingness to save (defer consumption) increases with a higher interest return, while firms’ willingness to invest in new capital decreases with higher financing costs. Equilibrium occurs when \\(S = I\\), and at that point the interest rate balances the economy’s ex ante saving and investment. An increase in desired saving (e.g. due to higher income or thriftiness) would shift the savings supply curve rightward and drive the equilibrium interest rate down, encouraging more investment. In this classical view, interest is ultimately governed by real factors (productivity and time preference) and saving-investment behavior, not directly by the quantity of money.\nKeynes’s liquidity preference theory, by contrast, emphasizes money market equilibrium. He did not deny that income affects saving and investment, but in the short run he assumed saving is mostly driven by income (via the marginal propensity to consume) rather than by the interest rate. Investment, on the other hand, depends on interest and profit expectations. In Keynes’s theory, the interest rate adjusts until money demanded = money supplied, given the level of income and money stock. For example, if income rises (more transactions), the money demand curve \\(L(Y,i)\\) shifts right; if the money supply is unchanged, this excess demand for money will drive up interest rates until people are content holding the available money (because higher \\(i\\) reduces the speculative and precautionary demand). Conversely, if the central bank increases the money supply, initially there is excess money in portfolios, so people try to rebalance by buying bonds and assets – bidding up their prices and pushing down the interest rate. Thus, in liquidity preference theory, an increase in income raises interest rates (money demand up), and an increase in money supply lowers interest rates (money supply up), ceteris paribus.\nKeynes’s view can be reconciled with the classical loanable funds approach by considering interactions in both goods and money markets simultaneously. In fact, the IS-LM model (originally formulated by John Hicks in 1937 as an interpretation of Keynes) combines the two: the IS curve captures equilibrium in the goods market (where investment equals saving, or equivalently aggregate demand equals output), and the LM curve captures equilibrium in the money market (liquidity preference equals money supply). We will use IS-LM shortly to analyze Keynesian equilibrium and disequilibrium conditions. First, however, we examine Keynes’s famous concept of the liquidity trap, an extreme case of liquidity preference with profound policy implications.\n\n\n\n\nKeynes’s theory of money demand begins with the recognition of three motives for holding money, expanding beyond the single transactions motive emphasized by classical economists. In classical thinking (e.g. quantity theory), people hold money only to facilitate transactions – the medium of exchange function – and any excess money would quickly be spent, rendering money neutral in its effect on the economy. Keynes acknowledged the transactions motive (holding money for routine purchases of goods and services) but also identified two additional motives arising from money’s role as a liquid store of value that pays no interest:\n• Precautionary motive – holding money for unexpected contingencies or emergencies that might require quick expenditure. Even households and firms with planned budgets keep some funds in readily accessible cash or deposits as a precaution against unforeseen events (medical bills, urgent repairs, etc.). This motive implies money demand increases with the uncertainty of the environment or the need for flexibility.\n• Speculative motive – holding money instead of other assets when the return on bonds or other interest-bearing assets is low, or when those assets are expected to fall in price. This is related to expectations about future interest rates. If people expect interest rates to rise (which means bond prices will fall), they may prefer to hold wealth in money now and wait for a better opportunity to buy bonds later. Money is perfectly liquid (it can be used directly for transactions and does not incur capital loss), whereas bonds and other assets carry interest but can fluctuate in value. The speculative demand for money is inversely related to the interest rate: when interest (\\(i\\)) is high, people are more willing to hold bonds (earning interest) and less inclined to hold idle money; but when \\(i\\) is low, the opportunity cost of holding money is small, so people are more inclined to keep wealth liquid in money form.\n\n\n\nKeynes formalized these ideas in his liquidity preference theory. The demand for money can be expressed as a function \\(L(Y, i)\\), where \\(Y\\) is income and \\(i\\) is the interest rate. The transactions and precautionary motives imply that \\(L\\) increases with real income \\(Y\\) (higher income means more spending and a larger buffer for contingencies). The speculative motive implies that \\(L\\) decreases as \\(i\\) rises (higher interest provides a reward for parting with liquidity). In other words:\n• \\(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial Y} &gt; 0\\): Higher income raises money demand (for transactions and safety reserves). • \\(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial i} &lt; 0\\): Higher interest rates reduce money demanded (as the public holds interest-bearing assets instead).\nKeynes described interest rate as the reward for relinquishing liquidity. Unlike classical theory which saw interest as the reward for saving (waiting to consume), Keynes argued that at any given level of income, the interest rate adjusts to equilibrate money demand with the fixed money supply. In equilibrium, money supply \\(M\\) = money demand \\(L(Y, i)\\), and the interest rate is the “price” that brings this about. If the central bank sets a fixed nominal money supply \\(M\\) (and for a given price level \\(P\\), a fixed real money supply \\(M/P\\)), then the interest rate will move until money market clears.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt very low interest rates \\(i_L\\), the speculative motive dominates: agents are reluctant to hold bonds because:\n\nYields are too low to compensate for inconvenience and illiquidity,\nThey expect rates cannot go much lower (so bond prices are “too high”) and thus fear capital losses when rates rise.\n\nHence the liquidity preference schedule becomes horizontal: money demand becomes infinitely interest-elastic.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Money demand - normal region\nM_normal &lt;- seq(0, 8, length.out = 50)\ni_normal &lt;- 8 - M_normal\n\n# Liquidity trap region\nM_trap &lt;- seq(8, 12, length.out = 20)\ni_trap &lt;- rep(1.5, length(M_trap))\n\n# Combine\ndf &lt;- data.frame(\n  M = c(M_normal, M_trap),\n  i = c(i_normal, i_trap)\n)\n\n# Plot\nggplot(df, aes(x = M, y = i)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"blue\", linewidth = 1.2) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 1.5, color = \"red\",  \n             linetype = \"dashed\", linewidth = 0.8, alpha = 0.7) +\n  annotate(\"rect\", xmin = 8, xmax = 12, ymin = 0, ymax = 1.5, \n           fill = \"red\", alpha = 0.15) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 10, y = 1.9, label = \"i[L]~(trap~floor)\", \n           parse = TRUE, color = \"red\", fontface = \"bold\", size = 4) +\n  annotate(\"rect\", xmin = 1.5, xmax = 4.5, ymin = 4.5, ymax = 5.5,\n           fill = \"wheat\", alpha = 0.7) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 3, y = 5, \n           label = \"Normal region:\\ndownward sloping\", \n           size = 3.5) +\n  labs(x = \"Money Demand (M)\", y = \"Interest Rate (i)\", \n       title = \"Liquidity Preference Schedule\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 12), ylim = c(0, 9))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Liquidity Preference Schedule with Liquidity Trap\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen liquidity preference is horizontal, an increase in money supply shifts portfolios into money balances without lowering \\(i\\) further. This is the canonical statement that conventional monetary policy becomes ineffective in a liquidity trap.\n\n\n\nThe major economies have faced liquidity trap conditions:\n\nBank of England (March 2009): Cut Bank Rate to 0.5% and launched an asset purchase programme (“QE”) to provide further monetary loosening once conventional policy was constrained.\nBank of Japan (1999–2001): Adopted a Zero Interest Rate Policy (ZIRP) in 1999 and Quantitative Easing in 2001, reflecting prolonged low-rate conditions consistent with liquidity-trap concerns.\nEuropean Central Bank (2014–2019): Introduced negative deposit facility rates in June 2014 and lowered them further (to -0.5% by 2019), reflecting attempts to relax constraints near the effective lower bound.\n\nThese episodes are best interpreted as policy responses to Keynesian concerns about weak demand at very low rates—though modern frameworks emphasize multiple transmission channels beyond the short rate (QE, forward guidance, credit policy).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn standard IS-LM, if the intersection occurs below potential output \\(\\bar{Y}\\), goods demand is weak, placing downward pressure on the price level \\(P\\).

Hence conventional monetary policy cannot affect aggregate demand in a liquidity trap. This is why central banks have resorted to unconventional measures (quantitative easing, forward guidance, credit policy).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe classical dichotomy implies a separation between nominal and real variables: in equilibrium, money affects only prices, not output or employment. Money is neutral in the long run – doubling the money supply eventually doubles all prices and wages, with no impact on real GDP, employment, or real interest rates.\n\n\n\nKeynes disputed the assumption of rapid, uniform nominal price adjustment, particularly in labour markets. He observed an “unevenness” in price adjustment: some prices (like wages in long-term contracts) are quite sticky or inflexible downwards, whereas others (like commodity prices or exchange rates) might be more flexible.\nIf nominal prices adjust unevenly, relative prices deviate from their market-clearing values for extended periods. Therefore:\n\nMoney is not neutral (at least over relevant horizons),\nDichotomy fails because money can affect real outcomes (relative prices, unemployment),\nMonetary policy has real effects in the short-to-medium term due to nominal rigidities.\n\nThis line of reasoning is foundational for why modern macroeconomics treats monetary policy as potentially stabilizing in the presence of nominal rigidities—even though long-run neutrality may still hold in many models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon Patinkin argued that money provides “utility” because it facilitates transactions; thus money should enter utility functions as a quasi-good, particularly in real terms \\(M/P\\). This insight forms the foundation of the Pigou effect critique.\n\n\n\nPigou’s argument applies Patinkin’s insight against Keynes’s trap logic: if demand depends positively on real balances, falling prices increase \\(M/P\\), potentially shifting IS right/up and closing the demand gap.\nThe mechanism: - Prices fall → real money balances (\\(M/P\\)) rise - Households and firms feel wealthier - Consumption and investment demand increase (wealth effect) - IS curve shifts rightward - Even in a liquidity trap (with \\(i_L\\) fixed), the rightward IS shift can eventually intersect LM at full employment \\(\\bar{Y}\\)\nThis implies the trap might be overcome by market forces alone.\n\n\n\nKeynesians offer several rebuttals:\n\nQuantitatively small or very slow-acting: In a deep recession or depression, people might be too pessimistic or liquidity-constrained to increase consumption just because prices are a bit lower. They might instead hoard any extra real wealth to rebuild balance sheets.\nDebt-deflation dynamics: Deflation raises the real burden of debt, which can reduce debtors’ spending (counteracting Pigou). This redistributes wealth from borrowers (who curtail spending) to creditors (who may not increase spending much), possibly resulting in a net drop in demand.\nDestabilizing expectations: Sustained deflation can worsen expectations – if people expect prices to keep falling, they might postpone purchases (the opposite of Pigou’s assumption), a dynamic observed in Japan’s deflationary period.\nInstitutional constraints: Prices and wages cannot fall indefinitely due to institutional and psychological limits. Central banks actively fight deflation for these reasons—for example, the ECB’s commitment to a positive inflation target (near 2%) is partly to avoid falling into a deflationary trap where any Pigou effect would be too feeble and slow.\n\n\n\n\nAll that said, the Pigou effect remains an important theoretical critique because it highlights a channel (wealth-consumption) that Keynes’s original model left out. In later developments of Keynesian theory, economists like Patinkin integrated real balances into the analysis, which helped reconcile some classical and Keynesian views. They concluded that if prices are perfectly flexible and wages adjust (so no other frictions), then even a liquidity trap would eventually be resolved by sufficient deflation raising real money balances – thus restoring long-run neutrality of money even if short-run non-neutrality is severe. However, if there are other constraints (like the inability of nominal interest to go below zero, or institutional and psychological limits to how much and how fast prices can fall), then the economy can suffer prolonged departures from full employment – just as Keynes asserted.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following points capture the essence of Keynes’s monetary economics in the context of lecture notes on Monetary Economics EC3014:\n\nIn a monetary economy, Walras’ Law does not imply Say’s Law – excess demand for money can co-exist with excess supply of goods.\nThe money market is exceptional – money’s nominal price does not adjust, supply is exogenous, and close substitutes are limited.\nUsually, interest rates and/or the price level can restore equilibrium, but sluggish adjustment can generate prolonged unemployment.\nIn a liquidity trap, money demand is infinitely interest-elastic – LM becomes horizontal and conventional monetary policy loses power.\nIn that case, price changes may not raise aggregate demand – AD becomes vertical in the trap logic.\nSay’s Law breaks down in a monetary economy – Keynes showed that excess saving can translate into hoarding money, destroying aggregate demand and causing unemployment.\nPigou and Patinkin offer a critique – rising real balances under deflation can potentially stimulate demand (Pigou effect), but this mechanism may be weak or slow in practice.\nEven outside traps, Keynes argues money is not neutral because price adjustment is uneven; the classical dichotomy fails.\nPolicy implications are profound – when the interest-rate channel is blocked (liquidity trap), policymakers must rely on unconventional tools (quantitative easing, fiscal policy, forward guidance) to restore demand.\n\n\n\n\nKeynes’s theory of money brought money demand and liquidity preference to the forefront of macroeconomics, fundamentally altering how we analyze interest rates and output. Unlike the classical one-dimensional view of money (for transactions only), Keynes identified multiple motives for holding money – transactions, precautionary, and speculative – which together imply that money demand depends on both income and interest rates. The interest rate, in turn, is viewed as the price that equilibrates the supply and demand for money (liquidity), rather than purely the reward for saving as in classical theory.\nWe explored the concept of the liquidity trap, Keynes’s most dramatic departure from classical thinking. In a liquidity trap, extremely low interest rates lead to a horizontal money demand curve – additional money gets hoarded rather than spent. The liquidity trap highlights how an economy can get stuck with inadequate demand, zero interest rates, and even deflation, rendering conventional monetary policy ineffective. The IS-LM disequilibrium analysis showed that in such a scenario, the usual self-correcting mechanisms (interest rate adjustment and price-level adjustment) may fail to restore full employment. This underlines Keynes’s broader point that money is not neutral, especially during economic downturns.\nThe experiences of Japan’s lost decade and the post-2008 global slump demonstrate the importance of Keynes’s insights: when money’s usual role as a lubricator of the economy breaks down, proactive measures are needed to avoid long-term stagnation. At the same time, the debate between Keynesian and classical views (as epitomized by the Pigou effect discussion) highlights that the long-run interaction between money and the real economy is complex. Overall, Keynes’s work ensures that economists and policymakers treat money not as a mere veil, but as a fundamental part of the economy’s structure that can shape macroeconomic outcomes.\n\n\n\nBenford, J., Berry, S., Nikolov, K., & Young, C.

    "text": "John Maynard Keynes revolutionized monetary economics by examining the roles money plays in the economy and their macroeconomic implications. Writing during the Great Depression, Keynes challenged the classical view that money is merely a neutral medium of exchange or “veil” that affects only prices but not real output or employment. In classical theory, the economy was thought to naturally gravitate to full employment equilibrium via flexible prices (the classical dichotomy), implying money had no real effects in the long run. Keynes, however, argued that in a monetary economy – where money actively influences decisions – there is no automatic guarantee of full employment. He developed a theory of liquidity preference and money demand that highlights how money can matter in both the short run and long run. This chapter examines Keynes’s theory of money demand (transactions, precautionary, and speculative motives), his concept of the liquidity trap, and the resulting disequilibrium analysis using the IS-LM model. We also contrast the neutrality of money in classical theory with Keynes’s view of non-neutrality, and discuss the Pigou effect as a classical critique of Keynes. Throughout, we integrate historical and contemporary examples – from Japan’s 1990s stagnation to post-2008 low interest environments in the US, UK, and Eurozone – to illustrate these concepts in practice.",

    "text": "Keynes’s key analytical move is to treat the money market as exceptional. In many markets, an excess demand triggers adjustment through at least three channels: (i) the good’s own price rises, (ii) supply expands, and (iii) agents substitute toward close substitutes. Keynes argued that these equilibrating forces are weak or absent for money in its role as a pure medium of exchange.\n\n\n\nKeynes highlighted three features of the money market that make it hard to clear through “normal” market mechanisms:\n\nThe nominal price of money is unresponsive to disequilibrium — Money has a face value. Unlike ordinary goods, an excess demand for money does not “bid up” the nominal value of money in the same way that excess demand for apples bids up apple prices.\nSupply is unresponsive because the money stock is exogenously determined — The stock of money is set by the monetary authority rather than being produced in response to higher “money prices”.\nThere are no close substitutes as media of exchange — Even if near-money instruments exist today, Keynes’s emphasis is that money’s payment finality and transactional acceptability are difficult to replicate fully. This matters when confidence collapses: agents may prefer money to specific private liabilities (bank deposits, firm credits) perceived as risky.\n\n\n\n\nIn modern financial systems, some substitutes exist (money market funds, repos, short-maturity government bills). However, Keynes’s core point survives: in stress episodes, investors demand the most liquid and safest instrument, and the system can experience a shortage of safe and liquid assets. This is consistent with observed “flight-to-quality” and “flight-to-liquidity” dynamics in financial crises.",

    "text": "In a non-monetary (or effectively barter) economy, an increase in saving typically reallocates demand rather than destroying it. Classical reasoning holds: higher saving means more purchases of durable goods or more lending to firms for investment, shifting production across sectors but leaving aggregate employment roughly unchanged.\nIn a monetary economy, however, higher desired saving can take the form of hoarding money (increasing money demand) rather than purchasing goods or financing investment. When this occurs:\n\nOverall demand for goods falls,\nDemand for money rises,\nLabour demand falls,\nUnemployment emerges.\n\n\n\n\nA crucial insight from the lecture notes: in a monetary economy, Walras’ Law no longer implies Say’s Law. An excess demand for money can co-exist with an excess supply of goods. When agents attempt to rebuild liquidity positions, desired spending falls below output. This is Keynes’s fundamental explanation for why unemployment can be an equilibrium outcome in a monetary economy: the “missing demand” is not redirected automatically into other goods; it can be redirected into money balances.",

Thus:\n\nA fall in \\(i\\) increases money demand (agents prefer liquidity over bonds),\nMoney demand and money supply jointly determine \\(i\\),\nHigher income shifts money demand right and raises \\(i\\) (via higher transactions demand).\n\nKeynes also notes the reconciliation with the classical view via a system approach (IS–LM), as later formalized by Hicks.\nClassical economists explained interest rate determination through the loanable funds market, where the interest rate adjusts to equate saving and investment. In that view (often illustrated by a supply-of-savings and demand-for-investment diagram), the interest rate is the price of funds: households’ willingness to save (defer consumption) increases with a higher interest return, while firms’ willingness to invest in new capital decreases with higher financing costs. Equilibrium occurs when \\(S = I\\), and at that point the interest rate balances the economy’s ex ante saving and investment. An increase in desired saving (e.g. due to higher income or thriftiness) would shift the savings supply curve rightward and drive the equilibrium interest rate down, encouraging more investment. In this classical view, interest is ultimately governed by real factors (productivity and time preference) and saving-investment behavior, not directly by the quantity of money.\nKeynes’s liquidity preference theory, by contrast, emphasizes money market equilibrium. He did not deny that income affects saving and investment, but in the short run he assumed saving is mostly driven by income (via the marginal propensity to consume) rather than by the interest rate. Investment, on the other hand, depends on interest and profit expectations. In Keynes’s theory, the interest rate adjusts until money demanded = money supplied, given the level of income and money stock. For example, if income rises (more transactions), the money demand curve \\(L(Y,i)\\) shifts right; if the money supply is unchanged, this excess demand for money will drive up interest rates until people are content holding the available money (because higher \\(i\\) reduces the speculative and precautionary demand). Conversely, if the central bank increases the money supply, initially there is excess money in portfolios, so people try to rebalance by buying bonds and assets – bidding up their prices and pushing down the interest rate. Thus, in liquidity preference theory, an increase in income raises interest rates (money demand up), and an increase in money supply lowers interest rates (money supply up), ceteris paribus.\nKeynes’s view can be reconciled with the classical loanable funds approach by considering interactions in both goods and money markets simultaneously. In fact, the IS-LM model (originally formulated by John Hicks in 1937 as an interpretation of Keynes) combines the two: the IS curve captures equilibrium in the goods market (where investment equals saving, or equivalently aggregate demand equals output), and the LM curve captures equilibrium in the money market (liquidity preference equals money supply). We will use IS-LM shortly to analyze Keynesian equilibrium and disequilibrium conditions. First, however, we examine Keynes’s famous concept of the liquidity trap, an extreme case of liquidity preference with profound policy implications.\n\n\n\n\nKeynes’s theory of money demand begins with the recognition of three motives for holding money, expanding beyond the single transactions motive emphasized by classical economists. In classical thinking (e.g. quantity theory), people hold money only to facilitate transactions – the medium of exchange function – and any excess money would quickly be spent, rendering money neutral in its effect on the economy. Keynes acknowledged the transactions motive (holding money for routine purchases of goods and services) but also identified two additional motives arising from money’s role as a liquid store of value that pays no interest:\n• Precautionary motive – holding money for unexpected contingencies or emergencies that might require quick expenditure. Even households and firms with planned budgets keep some funds in readily accessible cash or deposits as a precaution against unforeseen events (medical bills, urgent repairs, etc.). This motive implies money demand increases with the uncertainty of the environment or the need for flexibility.\n• Speculative motive – holding money instead of other assets when the return on bonds or other interest-bearing assets is low, or when those assets are expected to fall in price. This is related to expectations about future interest rates. If people expect interest rates to rise (which means bond prices will fall), they may prefer to hold wealth in money now and wait for a better opportunity to buy bonds later. Money is perfectly liquid (it can be used directly for transactions and does not incur capital loss), whereas bonds and other assets carry interest but can fluctuate in value. The speculative demand for money is inversely related to the interest rate: when interest (\\(i\\)) is high, people are more willing to hold bonds (earning interest) and less inclined to hold idle money; but when \\(i\\) is low, the opportunity cost of holding money is small, so people are more inclined to keep wealth liquid in money form.\n\n\n\nKeynes formalized these ideas in his liquidity preference theory. The demand for money can be expressed as a function \\(L(Y, i)\\), where \\(Y\\) is income and \\(i\\) is the interest rate. The transactions and precautionary motives imply that \\(L\\) increases with real income \\(Y\\) (higher income means more spending and a larger buffer for contingencies). The speculative motive implies that \\(L\\) decreases as \\(i\\) rises (higher interest provides a reward for parting with liquidity). In other words:\n• \\(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial Y} &gt; 0\\): Higher income raises money demand (for transactions and safety reserves). • \\(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial i} &lt; 0\\): Higher interest rates reduce money demanded (as the public holds interest-bearing assets instead).\nKeynes described interest rate as the reward for relinquishing liquidity. Unlike classical theory which saw interest as the reward for saving (waiting to consume), Keynes argued that at any given level of income, the interest rate adjusts to equilibrate money demand with the fixed money supply. In equilibrium, money supply \\(M\\) = money demand \\(L(Y, i)\\), and the interest rate is the “price” that brings this about. If the central bank sets a fixed nominal money supply \\(M\\) (and for a given price level \\(P\\), a fixed real money supply \\(M/P\\)), then the interest rate will move until money market clears.",

    "text": "The classical dichotomy implies a separation between nominal and real variables: in equilibrium, money affects only prices, not output or employment. Money is neutral in the long run – doubling the money supply eventually doubles all prices and wages, with no impact on real GDP, employment, or real interest rates.\n\n\n\nKeynes disputed the assumption of rapid, uniform nominal price adjustment, particularly in labour markets. He observed an “unevenness” in price adjustment: some prices (like wages in long-term contracts) are quite sticky or inflexible downwards, whereas others (like commodity prices or exchange rates) might be more flexible.\nIf nominal prices adjust unevenly, relative prices deviate from their market-clearing values for extended periods. Therefore:\n\nMoney is not neutral (at least over relevant horizons),\nDichotomy fails because money can affect real outcomes (relative prices, unemployment),\nMonetary policy has real effects in the short-to-medium term due to nominal rigidities.\n\nThis line of reasoning is foundational for why modern macroeconomics treats monetary policy as potentially stabilizing in the presence of nominal rigidities—even though long-run neutrality may still hold in many models.",

    "text": "Don Patinkin argued that money provides “utility” because it facilitates transactions; thus money should enter utility functions as a quasi-good, particularly in real terms \\(M/P\\). This insight forms the foundation of the Pigou effect critique.\n\n\n\nPigou’s argument applies Patinkin’s insight against Keynes’s trap logic: if demand depends positively on real balances, falling prices increase \\(M/P\\), potentially shifting IS right/up and closing the demand gap.\nThe mechanism: - Prices fall → real money balances (\\(M/P\\)) rise - Households and firms feel wealthier - Consumption and investment demand increase (wealth effect) - IS curve shifts rightward - Even in a liquidity trap (with \\(i_L\\) fixed), the rightward IS shift can eventually intersect LM at full employment \\(\\bar{Y}\\)\nThis implies the trap might be overcome by market forces alone.\n\n\n\nKeynesians offer several rebuttals:\n\nQuantitatively small or very slow-acting: In a deep recession or depression, people might be too pessimistic or liquidity-constrained to increase consumption just because prices are a bit lower. They might instead hoard any extra real wealth to rebuild balance sheets.\nDebt-deflation dynamics: Deflation raises the real burden of debt, which can reduce debtors’ spending (counteracting Pigou). This redistributes wealth from borrowers (who curtail spending) to creditors (who may not increase spending much), possibly resulting in a net drop in demand.\nDestabilizing expectations: Sustained deflation can worsen expectations – if people expect prices to keep falling, they might postpone purchases (the opposite of Pigou’s assumption), a dynamic observed in Japan’s deflationary period.\nInstitutional constraints: Prices and wages cannot fall indefinitely due to institutional and psychological limits. Central banks actively fight deflation for these reasons—for example, the ECB’s commitment to a positive inflation target (near 2%) is partly to avoid falling into a deflationary trap where any Pigou effect would be too feeble and slow.\n\n\n\n\nAll that said, the Pigou effect remains an important theoretical critique because it highlights a channel (wealth-consumption) that Keynes’s original model left out. In later developments of Keynesian theory, economists like Patinkin integrated real balances into the analysis, which helped reconcile some classical and Keynesian views. They concluded that if prices are perfectly flexible and wages adjust (so no other frictions), then even a liquidity trap would eventually be resolved by sufficient deflation raising real money balances – thus restoring long-run neutrality of money even if short-run non-neutrality is severe. However, if there are other constraints (like the inability of nominal interest to go below zero, or institutional and psychological limits to how much and how fast prices can fall), then the economy can suffer prolonged departures from full employment – just as Keynes asserted.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Keynes’s theory of money brought money demand and liquidity preference to the forefront of macroeconomics, fundamentally altering how we analyze interest rates and output. Unlike the classical one-dimensional view of money (for transactions only), Keynes identified multiple motives for holding money – transactions, precautionary, and speculative – which together imply that money demand depends on both income and interest rates. The interest rate, in turn, is viewed as the price that equilibrates the supply and demand for money (liquidity), rather than purely the reward for saving as in classical theory.\nWe explored the concept of the liquidity trap, Keynes’s most dramatic departure from classical thinking. In a liquidity trap, extremely low interest rates lead to a horizontal money demand curve – additional money gets hoarded rather than spent. The liquidity trap highlights how an economy can get stuck with inadequate demand, zero interest rates, and even deflation, rendering conventional monetary policy ineffective. The IS-LM disequilibrium analysis showed that in such a scenario, the usual self-correcting mechanisms (interest rate adjustment and price-level adjustment) may fail to restore full employment. This underlines Keynes’s broader point that money is not neutral, especially during economic downturns.\nThe experiences of Japan’s lost decade and the post-2008 global slump demonstrate the importance of Keynes’s insights: when money’s usual role as a lubricator of the economy breaks down, proactive measures are needed to avoid long-term stagnation. At the same time, the debate between Keynesian and classical views (as epitomized by the Pigou effect discussion) highlights that the long-run interaction between money and the real economy is complex. Overall, Keynes’s work ensures that economists and policymakers treat money not as a mere veil, but as a fundamental part of the economy’s structure that can shape macroeconomic outcomes.",

Therefore: \\[\\theta = 4, \\quad N = 400, \\quad Y = 3200 \\text{ (unchanged)}\\] \\[W_1 = 4 \\times 7.5 = 30\\]\n\n\n\nYes, the model exhibits dichotomy and neutrality of money. Real variables (\\(\\theta\\), \\(N\\), \\(Y\\)) are determined solely by production technology and labour supply preferences, independent of the money supply. A 50% increase in \\(M\\) (from 32000 to 48000) causes exactly proportional increases in nominal variables (prices and wages double from \\(5 \\to 7.5\\), \\(20 \\to 30\\)) but leaves all real variables unchanged. This demonstrates classical neutrality: in the long run, money is a veil over the real economy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart (a)\n\n\n\n\n\nWith workers using \\(P_0 = 5\\) as the reference price: \\[N^S = 100\\frac{W'}{5} = 20W'\\]\nSetting \\(N^S = N^D\\): \\[20W' = \\frac{6400}{(\\theta')^2} = \\frac{6400(P')^2}{(W')^2}\\] \\[(W')^3 = \\frac{6400(P')^2}{20} = 320(P')^2\\] \\[P' = \\frac{\\sqrt{(W')^3}}{\\sqrt{320}} = \\frac{(W')^{3/2}}{\\sqrt{320}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{80}(W')^{3/2}}{160}\\]\n\n\nFrom the labour supply: \\(N' = 20W'\\)\nPlugging into production function: \\[Y' = 160\\sqrt{20W'}\\]\nFrom the QTM with \\(M_1 = 48000\\): \\[P' = \\frac{M_1}{kY'} = \\frac{48000}{2 \\times 160\\sqrt{20W'}} = \\frac{150}{\\sqrt{20W'}}\\]\n\n\n\nEquating the two expressions for \\(P'\\): \\[\\frac{\\sqrt{80}(W')^{3/2}}{160} = \\frac{150}{\\sqrt{20W'}}\\]\nSolving: \\[(W')^2 = \\frac{150^2 \\times 160^2}{80 \\times 20} = 600\\] \\[W' \\approx 24.49\\]\nTherefore: \\[N' = 20 \\times 24.49 = 489.8\\] \\[Y' = 160\\sqrt{489.8} \\approx 3545.7\\] \\[P' = \\frac{48000}{2 \\times 3545.7} \\approx 6.76\\] \\[\\theta' = \\frac{W'}{P'} = \\frac{24.49}{6.76} \\approx 3.62\\]\nNote that \\(\\theta' = 3.62 &lt; 4 = \\theta_0\\), but \\(W' = 24.49 &gt; 20 = W_0\\).

Workers observe \\(W' &gt; W_0\\) and perceive a real wage increase even though \\(\\theta' &lt; \\theta_0\\). This illusion causes labour supply to expand far beyond its natural level, pulling down the real wage and increasing both employment and output above their long-run levels.\nShort run: Monetary expansion stimulates employment (\\(N' = 489.8 &gt; 400\\)) and output (\\(Y' = 3545.7 &gt; 3200\\)) because workers are fooled about inflation.\nLong run: When workers eventually recognise that \\(P'\\) has risen more than \\(W'\\), they realise their real wage has fallen. Labour supply contracts back to its natural level, \\(N\\) returns to 400, \\(Y\\) reverts to 3200, and \\(\\theta\\) returns to 4.\nThis supports Friedman’s argument that monetary policy has temporary real effects in the short run but is neutral in the long run—the lag between actual and perceived inflation is crucial to short-run monetary non-neutrality. The Phillips curve is downward-sloping in the short run (trade-off between inflation and unemployment) but vertical in the long run (no permanent trade-off).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart (a)\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the dynamic QTM: \\[\\pi = g_M - g_Y = 3\\% - 1\\% = 2\\%\\]\nFrom the Fisher equation: \\[i = r + \\pi = 2\\% + 2\\% = 4\\%\\]\n\n\nWhen \\(g_M\\) accelerates from \\(3\\%\\) to \\(6\\%\\):\nShort Run:\n\n(i) Growth rate of output temporarily rises above \\(1\\%\\) (to ~\\(1.5\\%\\)). The increase in money growth stimulates employment and output via money illusion. Workers see nominal wages rising faster than expected and supply more labour, pushing output above trend.\n(ii) Rate of inflation rises but lags the increase in money growth (to ~\\(3-4\\%\\), less than the full \\(5\\%\\)). Initially, prices adjust slowly while the monetary expansion feeds into employment growth. The inflation gap (\\(g_M - \\pi &gt; 0\\)) creates the real stimulus.\n(iii) Nominal interest rate initially falls below \\(4\\%\\) (to ~\\(3\\%\\)). Real rates are pushed down as inflation expectations lag, and the output boom creates downward pressure on interest rates.\n(iv) Real interest rate falls temporarily below \\(2\\%\\) into negative territory. The excess money supply and output expansion compress real returns.\n\nLong Run:\n\n(i) Growth rate of output returns to \\(1\\%\\). Once workers and firms perceive the true inflation, they adjust expectations. Labour supply reverts to its natural level, and output growth returns to its trend determined by labour force growth and technology.\n(ii) Rate of inflation settles at \\(\\pi = g_M - g_Y = 6\\% - 1\\% = 5\\%\\). The full monetary impulse translates to inflation once expectations fully adjust.\n(iii) Nominal interest rate rises to \\(i = r + \\pi = 2\\% + 5\\% = 7\\%\\). Higher inflation raises nominal rates accordingly.\n(iv) Real interest rate returns to \\(2\\%\\).

But as workers and firms recognise true inflation, real variables return to their natural levels and the full monetary impulse translates into higher inflation and nominal rates. This illustrates the expectations-augmented Phillips curve: a short-run trade-off between inflation and output growth, but a vertical long-run Phillips curve at the natural rate of unemployment."

Therefore: \\[\\theta = \\frac{80}{\\sqrt{N}}\\] \\[\\sqrt{N} = \\frac{80}{\\theta}\\] \\[N = \\frac{6400}{\\theta^2}\\]\nThis matches the given labour demand equation, confirming consistency. ✓\n\n\nSetting \\(N^S = N^D\\): \\[100\\theta = \\frac{6400}{\\theta^2}\\] \\[100\\theta^3 = 6400\\] \\[\\theta^3 = 64\\] \\[\\theta = 4\\]\nTherefore: \\(N = 100 \\times 4 = 400\\)\nSubstituting into the production function: \\[Y = 160\\sqrt{400} = 160 \\times 20 = 3200\\]\n\n\n\nFrom the QTM: \\(P = \\frac{M}{kY}\\)\nWith \\(M_0 = 32000\\) and \\(k = 2\\): \\[P_0 = \\frac{32000}{2 \\times 3200} = \\frac{32000}{6400} = 5\\]\nThe money wage is: \\[W_0 = \\theta \\times P_0 = 4 \\times 5 = 20\\]\n\n\n\nWith \\(M_1 = 48000\\): \\[P_1 = \\frac{48000}{2 \\times 3200} = \\frac{48000}{6400} = 7.5\\]\nIn long-run equilibrium, the labour market remains at its natural level regardless of money supply changes. Therefore: \\[\\theta = 4, \\quad N = 400, \\quad Y = 3200 \\text{ (unchanged)}\\] \\[W_1 = 4 \\times 7.5 = 30\\]\n\n\n\nYes, the model exhibits dichotomy and neutrality of money. Real variables (\\(\\theta\\), \\(N\\), \\(Y\\)) are determined solely by production technology and labour supply preferences, independent of the money supply. A 50% increase in \\(M\\) (from 32000 to 48000) causes exactly proportional increases in nominal variables (prices and wages double from \\(5 \\to 7.5\\), \\(20 \\to 30\\)) but leaves all real variables unchanged. This demonstrates classical neutrality: in the long run, money is a veil over the real economy."

Workers observe \\(W' &gt; W_0\\) and perceive a real wage increase even though \\(\\theta' &lt; \\theta_0\\). This illusion causes labour supply to expand far beyond its natural level, pulling down the real wage and increasing both employment and output above their long-run levels.\nShort run: Monetary expansion stimulates employment (\\(N' = 489.8 &gt; 400\\)) and output (\\(Y' = 3545.7 &gt; 3200\\)) because workers are fooled about inflation.\nLong run: When workers eventually recognise that \\(P'\\) has risen more than \\(W'\\), they realise their real wage has fallen. Labour supply contracts back to its natural level, \\(N\\) returns to 400, \\(Y\\) reverts to 3200, and \\(\\theta\\) returns to 4.\nThis supports Friedman’s argument that monetary policy has temporary real effects in the short run but is neutral in the long run—the lag between actual and perceived inflation is crucial to short-run monetary non-neutrality. The Phillips curve is downward-sloping in the short run (trade-off between inflation and unemployment) but vertical in the long run (no permanent trade-off)."

The inflation gap (\\(g_M - \\pi &gt; 0\\)) creates the real stimulus.\n(iii) Nominal interest rate initially falls below \\(4\\%\\) (to ~\\(3\\%\\)).

This illustrates the expectations-augmented Phillips curve: a short-run trade-off between inflation and output growth, but a vertical long-run Phillips curve at the natural rate of unemployment."

    "text": "Tip\n\n\n\n\n\nAdaptive Expectations: Backward-Looking\nThe first claim is true. Adaptive expectations are formed by using the observed historical time path of a variable to project its future expected value. This approach is inherently backward-looking because it ignores the possibility that a variable’s trajectory might suddenly change if one of its underlying determinants changes.\nFor example, if inflation has been 2% for several years, adaptive expectations would predict future inflation around 2%, even if the central bank has just announced a permanent increase in money growth targeting 5% inflation. The model would only gradually adjust expectations upward as inflation actually rises over time.\nRational Expectations: Forward-Looking\nThe second claim is best understood in reverse: rational expectations naturally lead to forward-looking forecasting behaviour. A rational agent recognises that variables are interdependent and uses a model describing mutual inter-relationships between variables to predict future values of endogenous variables, using all available information about future exogenous variables.\nUnder rational expectations, whenever an agent is informed that an exogenous variable will deviate from its historical trend, they can correctly forecast that the endogenous variable they’re interested in will also deviate from its own historical trend. This ability to forecast sudden deviations from observed patterns makes rational expectations forward-looking.\nExample: Predictable vs Unpredictable Money Changes\n\nPredictable money increase: Under adaptive expectations, workers don’t anticipate the wage inflation coming from increased money supply. They’re surprised by higher nominal wages, work more (thinking real wages rose), and output expands temporarily.\nUnder rational expectations, if workers know the central bank has announced a permanent money increase, they predict prices and wages will rise proportionally. They don’t increase labour supply, output remains unchanged—money is neutral even in the short run.\n\nThis illustrates the key difference: rational expectations allow agents to anticipate and respond to announced future changes, making the economy respond differently than adaptive expectations would suggest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Lucas Aggregate Supply Equation\nThe Lucas AS equation expresses a relationship between deviations of output from its full-employment level and deviations of the price level from its expected value:\n\\[Y_t - Y^* = \\kappa(P_t - E_{t-1}P_t)\\]\nIn words: output deviates from potential only when actual prices differ from expected prices—that is, when agents face price surprises.\nConnection to Friedman’s Monetary Policy Analysis\nThe Lucas AS equation explains Friedman’s argument about short-run monetary effects through the following mechanism:\n\nAn unpredictable increase in money causes prices to rise unexpectedly\nWorkers and firms observe higher nominal wages/prices but expect lower inflation\nMisperceiving real wages as higher, workers supply more labour\nOutput temporarily expands above potential\nOnce expectations adjust and workers realise prices are higher, output returns to \\(Y^*\\)\n\nThis captures Friedman’s key insight: monetary policy affects real variables (output and employment) only when unpredictable, creating a temporary Phillips curve trade-off in the short run.\nBeyond Friedman: The Volatility Effect\nHowever, the Lucas version based on rational expectations reveals something Friedman’s analysis didn’t emphasise: the magnitude of the output effect depends on monetary volatility.\nLucas showed that the coefficient \\(\\kappa\\) is inversely proportional to the volatility of monetary policy. When monetary policy is highly volatile: - Agents realise that price fluctuations are largely driven by unpredictable money changes - They discount price surprises in making supply decisions - Price surprises have smaller effects on output\nThus, the Lucas AS equation not only explains Friedman’s short-run effects but also shows that more volatile monetary policy paradoxically produces smaller real effects—a distinctly New Classical insight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Lucas AS Equation and Monetary Shocks\nIn the New Classical model, the Lucas AS equation states:\n\\[Y_t - Y^* = \\kappa(P_t - E_{t-1}P_t)\\]\nwhere output deviates from potential only when actual prices exceed expected prices.\nThe Relationship Between Money and Price Surprises\nWith rational expectations, the price surprise is related to the money surprise by:\n\\[P_t - E_{t-1}P_t = \\frac{1}{1+\\kappa}(M_t - E_{t-1}M_t)\\]\nCombining these gives the relationship between unpredictable monetary shocks and output:\n\\[Y_t - Y^* = \\frac{\\kappa}{1+\\kappa}(M_t - E_{t-1}M_t)\\]\nNote that the coefficient \\(\\frac{\\kappa}{1+\\kappa}\\) decreases as \\(\\kappa\\) increases—and Lucas proved that \\(\\kappa\\) is inversely proportional to monetary volatility.\nIntuitive Explanation\nWhen monetary policy is highly volatile:\n\nAgents experience frequent, large, unpredictable fluctuations in the money supply and prices\nThey realise that most price changes are driven by monetary shocks, not real productivity changes\nWhen they observe a price increase, rational agents ask: “Is this real inflation or just monetary noise?”\nRecognising it’s likely monetary noise, they discount the price signal and don’t adjust supply decisions much\nThe measured \\(\\kappa\\) (sensitivity of output to price surprises) becomes very small\nResult: Output remains closer to potential despite frequent price surprises\n\nConversely, when monetary policy is predictable and stable:\n\nAgents see price changes as more likely reflecting real demand shifts\nPrice surprises are taken as genuine signals about real conditions\nAgents respond more strongly to price changes\n\\(\\kappa\\) is larger, and unpredictable monetary changes have bigger output effects\n\nThe Paradox\nThis creates an apparent paradox: money affects output only by being unpredictable, yet the more unpredictable money is, the smaller its real effects become.\nThe resolution is that rational agents learn the volatility characteristics of monetary policy and adjust their attention to different types of signals. In a highly volatile monetary environment, price signals become noisier and less informative about real conditions, so agents respond less to them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Problem: Systematic Policy is Predictable\nIn standard New Classical theory, a systematic monetary policy rule—where money supply is deliberately set according to some formula—is predictable by rational agents. They form expectations based on this anticipated money supply, rendering the policy unable to affect real variables. Monetary policy cannot systematically stabilise the economy.\nThe Solution: Exploiting Information Asymmetry\nHowever, a special combination of circumstances allows systematic stabilisation:\n(i) Technology shocks with persistence: Productivity shocks whose effects persist over multiple periods (not just the current period). A negative productivity shock reduces output not only immediately but through reduced capital productivity in subsequent periods.\n(ii) Information asymmetry: The central bank observes these technology shocks as they arise, but the public learns about them only after their effects have dissipated or become much smaller.\nHow Systematic Policy Can Work\nHolding money constant, a recessionary technology shock would: - Reduce output in period \\(t\\) (when shock occurs) - Continue damaging output in periods \\(t+1\\), \\(t+2\\), etc. (persistence effect)\nBut if the central bank, having observed the shock, conditions future money supply over several periods on the shock’s magnitude, it can eliminate the persistence effect:\nExample: Following a recessionary productivity shock, 1. Central bank observes the shock in period \\(t\\) (public doesn’t yet know its magnitude) 2. Central bank increases money supply in periods \\(t+1\\), \\(t+2\\), etc. 3. This increases aggregate demand and raises the price level 4. Since public doesn’t yet know the magnitude of the supply shock, they don’t perfectly predict the money increase 5. The resulting price surprise stimulates employment and output, offsetting the negative supply-side effect 6. By quantitatively linking money injections to observed shock size, the central bank can precisely neutralise output persistence\nThe Role of the Policy Rule\nCrucially, the policy follows a known rule: “If we observe a productivity shock of size \\(X\\), we will expand money by \\(Y\\).”\n\nRational agents know this rule, so they can predict it ex-ante\nBut they lack current information on shock magnitude, so they cannot predict the exact money expansion that will result\nThe policy is “systematic” (not arbitrary) yet remains unpredictable to the public\n\nKey Insight\nThis works because the central bank has a comparative information advantage. It observes current shocks faster than the public; it uses this advantage to inject money that will be surprising (but predictable in principle if you knew the shock size). The public, knowing the policy rule but not current shock magnitudes, cannot perfectly predict the resulting money supply, leaving room for systematic policy to have real effects.\nImplications\nThis explains why central banks focus on real-time shock monitoring (employment data, inflation, financial conditions) and why forward guidance is only effective when it conveys new information the public doesn’t have—not merely statements of predictable rules."

Under floating exchange rates, the high-inflation currency depreciates, reflecting the difference in inflation rates.\nThe Fixed Exchange Rate Solution\nOne approach for a high-inflation country to reduce inflation is to unilaterally fix its exchange rate against a low-inflation anchor currency.

By surrendering monetary autonomy, the CB signals commitment to low inflation.\nProblems with Fixed Exchange Rates:\n(i) Weak Commitment Signal\nFixing the exchange rate is not the most obvious or direct way to signal commitment to low inflation. Other mechanisms might more clearly demonstrate policy resolve without restricting policy flexibility.\n(ii) Recurring Balance-of-Payments Deficits\nIf the fixed rate is set too low (too many units of local currency per anchor currency unit), the economy experiences recurring trade deficits. These deficits steadily deplete the central bank’s foreign exchange reserves, which cannot be replenished if monetary growth is constrained. Eventually, reserve depletion forces either devaluation or regime abandonment.\n(iii) Loss of Monetary Autonomy During Shocks\nWhen recessionary technology or demand shocks hit the economy, the CB may want to expand the money supply to stabilise domestic output. But the fixed rate peg prevents this, forcing the economy to bear the full burden of adjustment through price and wage deflation—a costly process.\n(iv) Speculative Attacks\nIf markets suspect the peg is unsustainable (due to depleting reserves or political pressure to abandon it), they may engage in speculative attacks—selling the currency en masse to force devaluation. These attacks can be self-fulfilling, destroying reserves and forcing the very devaluation speculators expected.\nAlternative Credibility Mechanisms:\n(i) Adopting Policy Rules Rather Than Discretion\nInstead of relying on discretionary decisions, the CB can commit to a transparent rule—e.g., “the money supply grows at 2% annually” or “inflation must stay within a 1-3% band.” Rules constrain the CB’s ability to pursue short-term output objectives and make policy predictable. However, rules limit flexibility during genuine emergencies.\n(ii) Appointing a Conservative, Inflation-Hawk Central Banker\nCredibility can be strengthened by appointing a CB governor known to be strongly committed to price stability and skeptical of inflation. If the CB leader has a public reputation as an inflation-hawk, markets and the public expect low inflation regardless of political pressure. Examples include Paul Volcker (US Fed) or the Bundesbank leadership.\n(iii) Performance-Based Compensation and Incentive Schemes\nAdd personal financial rewards and penalties to CB officials’ compensation based on inflation outcomes. For example, senior CB managers receive bonuses if inflation stays below target but face penalties if it exceeds target. This aligns personal incentives with low-inflation objectives, counteracting bureaucratic or political biases toward expansionary policy. It makes the commitment credible because officials’ own financial interests depend on delivering low inflation.\nComparative Effectiveness\nThese mechanisms address the time-inconsistency problem differently: - Rules eliminate discretion ex-post - Conservative leadership creates strong ex-ante reputation and expectations of resistance to inflation - Performance incentives align individual incentives with institutional objectives, making officials directly accountable\nThe most credible approach typically combines multiple mechanisms: clear rules, conservative leadership, transparency, and performance accountability."

    "text": "Tip\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem 1: Central Banks Control the Monetary Base, Not the Money Supply\nThe fundamental issue is that central banks only directly control the monetary base (\\(M_0\\))—cash in circulation plus bank reserves. However, conventional monetary aggregates like \\(M_1\\) and \\(M_2\\) also include demand deposits and other bank liabilities created by the commercial banking sector, not the central bank.\nThe relationship between the monetary base and broader money aggregates depends on the money multiplier, which is determined by: - Commercial banks’ reserve requirements - Banks’ reserve management decisions (which vary over time) - The public’s preferences for cash vs deposits\nWhen banks hold excess reserves or reduce lending, the money multiplier contracts, meaning the CB cannot reliably control the broader money supply even if it controls the base. This became especially problematic during financial crises when banks hoarded reserves and the money multiplier collapsed.\nProblem 2: Money Demand is Unstable\nThe second problem contradicts a key assumption of the Quantity Theory of Money: that the demand for money is a stable, predictable function of nominal income.\nIn reality, money demand shifted significantly due to: - Financial innovation: Development of money market mutual funds, sweep accounts, and other near-money instruments that allowed the public to minimize cash holdings - Changing payment technologies: Credit cards, electronic funds transfers, and later digital payments reduced the need to hold transaction balances - Deregulation: Removal of deposit interest rate ceilings allowed competition, shifting funds between deposits and other financial assets\nThese shifts meant that targeting a particular growth rate for the money supply did not reliably control inflation or output. For example, if the CB targeted \\(M_1\\) growth at 5%, but money demand shifted inward due to financial innovation, the actual growth in monetary liquidity would be much less, potentially causing economic contraction despite the CB “hitting” its money growth target.\nThe Combined Effect: Loss of Control\nTogether, these two problems meant that: 1. The CB could not reliably control the money supply (only the base) 2. Even if it could, controlling money growth didn’t reliably control inflation (because money demand was unstable)\nThis motivated the shift toward interest rate targeting as the primary policy instrument, which offers more direct control over financial conditions and is less dependent on the stability of money demand or the money multiplier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nPoint 1: Risk of Deflation\nIf the central bank targets zero inflation, there is only downside risk of deflation. In practice, inflation fluctuates around any target due to shocks and forecasting errors. With a zero target:\n\nInflation might temporarily fall to \\(-1\\%\\), \\(-2\\%\\), or lower\nOnce deflation begins, it can be self-reinforcing: expectations of falling prices cause households and firms to delay spending, further reducing demand and pushing prices down\nDeflation creates the zero lower bound problem: nominal interest rates cannot fall below zero, limiting the CB’s ability to stimulate the economy\nIn a deflationary episode, real interest rates become too high even when nominal rates are zero, making borrowing expensive and investment unattractive\n\nHistorical example: Japan’s “Lost Decade” (1990s) saw deflation that made monetary policy ineffective despite near-zero nominal rates.\nPoint 2: The Zero Lower Bound and Interest Rates\nRelated to the deflation risk is the constraint on monetary policy transmission. If the CB targets zero inflation:\n\nThe equilibrium real interest rate must be achieved through nominal rates close to zero\nWhen shocks hit, the CB has little room to cut rates further\nThe nominal interest rate hits the zero lower bound, preventing real rate cuts\nMonetary policy becomes powerless when the economy most needs stimulus\n\nWith a positive inflation target (e.g., 2%), the CB has a buffer. When it needs to cut the nominal rate to stimulate, there’s room before hitting zero. For example, if inflation is 2% and the natural real rate is 2%, the CB can set the nominal rate at 4% (= 2% + 2%), leaving room to cut rates during recessions.\nPoint 3: The Wage Adjustment Mechanism\nA critical but indirect mechanism is that moderate inflation allows real wages to fall without nominal wage cuts.\nIn recessions with high unemployment, there is downward pressure on real wages. But: - Nominal wage cuts are politically unpopular and resisted by workers - Labour contracts often have downward rigidity in nominal wages - If nominal wages cannot fall but inflation erodes the real value, real wages adjust\nWith positive inflation (say 2%): - A worker’s nominal wage stays at $50,000 but prices rise 2% - Real wage falls from \\(50,000/\\)P_0$ to \\(50,000/\\)P_1$ - This real adjustment allows labour markets to clear during downturns\nWith zero inflation target: - If real wages must fall to clear the labour market, firms must negotiate nominal wage cuts - Workers resist, unemployment persists - The economy cannot efficiently adjust to shocks\nThis is particularly important during periods of high unemployment when downward pressure on real wages would normally help restore labour market equilibrium.\nSummary of Three Problems\n\nDeflation risk → monetary policy becomes ineffective (zero lower bound)\nInterest rate constraint → less room to stimulate during recessions\nWage rigidity → real wage adjustment becomes harder, prolonging unemployment\n\nMost central banks target 2% inflation as a compromise: high enough to provide a buffer against deflation and interest rate constraints, yet low enough to maintain price stability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Primary Instrument: The Policy (Base) Interest Rate\nThe policy rate (also called the base rate or overnight rate) is the interest rate at which the central bank lends short-term funds—typically overnight—to commercial banks. Major central banks (Federal Reserve, ECB, Bank of England, etc.) set this rate as their primary policy instrument.\nThe Three Main Transmission Channels\nChanges in the policy rate affect inflation through three distinct channels:\n\n\nThis is the gradual transmission through the financial system:\n\nInterbank markets: When the CB raises the policy rate, banks paying higher overnight rates pass increased costs through the interbank lending market\nMoney market rates: Rates on commercial paper, certificates of deposit, and other money market instruments rise\nBank lending rates: Banks increase rates on mortgages, business loans, and consumer credit\nFirm and household decisions: Higher borrowing costs cause:\n\nFirms to cut investment (returns lower relative to borrowing cost)\nHouseholds to reduce consumption (especially discretionary spending and home purchases)\n\nGoods and labour markets: Reduced spending decreases demand for goods and labour\nWages and prices: Lower labour demand reduces wage growth; reduced goods demand reduces price growth\n\nEffect on inflation: Slower growth in wages and prices → lower inflation\n\n\n\nThis works through central bank communication and expectations:\n\nCB signals intent: When the CB raises the policy rate, it signals that it intends to bring inflation down\nForward guidance: The CB may explicitly state that rates will remain high until inflation targets are met\nWage and price setter expectations: Workers and firms, believing inflation will fall, moderate their own wage and price demands\nImmediate effect: Even before spending contracts significantly, inflation expectations fall because wage and price setters anticipate lower inflation ahead\nSelf-fulfilling: As workers accept lower nominal wage growth and firms set lower prices (expecting lower future inflation), inflation actually falls faster\n\nEffect on inflation: Faster reduction in inflation through expectation management and forward guidance\n\n\n\nThis works through international financial flows:\n\nHigher domestic rates: The CB raises the policy rate\nCapital attraction: Higher returns attract foreign investment seeking yield\nCurrency appreciation: Increased foreign demand for the domestic currency causes it to appreciate\nLower import prices: An appreciated currency makes foreign goods cheaper in domestic terms (e.g., if the dollar appreciates, US importers pay fewer dollars for foreign goods)\nReduced inflation: Cheaper imports directly lower consumer price indices and reduce inflationary pressure from import costs\nCompetitiveness effect: Appreciated currency also makes domestic exports more expensive abroad, reducing external demand and further dampening inflation\n\nEffect on inflation: Through lower import prices and reduced external demand\n\nDiagram: Monetary Policy Transmission Channels\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nWarning: package 'ggplot2' was built under R version

    "text": "Tip\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem 1: Central Banks Control the Monetary Base, Not the Money Supply\nThe fundamental issue is that central banks only directly control the monetary base (\\(M_0\\))—cash in circulation plus bank reserves. However, conventional monetary aggregates like \\(M_1\\) and \\(M_2\\) also include demand deposits and other bank liabilities created by the commercial banking sector, not the central bank.\nThe relationship between the monetary base and broader money aggregates depends on the money multiplier, which is determined by: - Commercial banks’ reserve requirements - Banks’ reserve management decisions (which vary over time) - The public’s preferences for cash vs deposits\nWhen banks hold excess reserves or reduce lending, the money multiplier contracts, meaning the CB cannot reliably control the broader money supply even if it controls the base. This became especially problematic during financial crises when banks hoarded reserves and the money multiplier collapsed.\nProblem 2: Money Demand is Unstable\nThe second problem contradicts a key assumption of the Quantity Theory of Money: that the demand for money is a stable, predictable function of nominal income.\nIn reality, money demand shifted significantly due to: - Financial innovation: Development of money market mutual funds, sweep accounts, and other near-money instruments that allowed the public to minimize cash holdings - Changing payment technologies: Credit cards, electronic funds transfers, and later digital payments reduced the need to hold transaction balances - Deregulation: Removal of deposit interest rate ceilings allowed competition, shifting funds between deposits and other financial assets\nThese shifts meant that targeting a particular growth rate for the money supply did not reliably control inflation or output. For example, if the CB targeted \\(M_1\\) growth at 5%, but money demand shifted inward due to financial innovation, the actual growth in monetary liquidity would be much less, potentially causing economic contraction despite the CB “hitting” its money growth target.\nThe Combined Effect: Loss of Control\nTogether, these two problems meant that: 1. The CB could not reliably control the money supply (only the base) 2. Even if it could, controlling money growth didn’t reliably control inflation (because money demand was unstable)\nThis motivated the shift toward interest rate targeting as the primary policy instrument, which offers more direct control over financial conditions and is less dependent on the stability of money demand or the money multiplier."

    "text": "Tip\n\n\n\n\n\nPoint 1: Risk of Deflation\nIf the central bank targets zero inflation, there is only downside risk of deflation. In practice, inflation fluctuates around any target due to shocks and forecasting errors. With a zero target:\n\nInflation might temporarily fall to \\(-1\\%\\), \\(-2\\%\\), or lower\nOnce deflation begins, it can be self-reinforcing: expectations of falling prices cause households and firms to delay spending, further reducing demand and pushing prices down\nDeflation creates the zero lower bound problem: nominal interest rates cannot fall below zero, limiting the CB’s ability to stimulate the economy\nIn a deflationary episode, real interest rates become too high even when nominal rates are zero, making borrowing expensive and investment unattractive\n\nHistorical example: Japan’s “Lost Decade” (1990s) saw deflation that made monetary policy ineffective despite near-zero nominal rates.\nPoint 2: The Zero Lower Bound and Interest Rates\nRelated to the deflation risk is the constraint on monetary policy transmission. If the CB targets zero inflation:\n\nThe equilibrium real interest rate must be achieved through nominal rates close to zero\nWhen shocks hit, the CB has little room to cut rates further\nThe nominal interest rate hits the zero lower bound, preventing real rate cuts\nMonetary policy becomes powerless when the economy most needs stimulus\n\nWith a positive inflation target (e.g., 2%), the CB has a buffer. When it needs to cut the nominal rate to stimulate, there’s room before hitting zero. For example, if inflation is 2% and the natural real rate is 2%, the CB can set the nominal rate at 4% (= 2% + 2%), leaving room to cut rates during recessions.\nPoint 3: The Wage Adjustment Mechanism\nA critical but indirect mechanism is that moderate inflation allows real wages to fall without nominal wage cuts.\nIn recessions with high unemployment, there is downward pressure on real wages. But: - Nominal wage cuts are politically unpopular and resisted by workers - Labour contracts often have downward rigidity in nominal wages - If nominal wages cannot fall but inflation erodes the real value, real wages adjust\nWith positive inflation (say 2%): - A worker’s nominal wage stays at $50,000 but prices rise 2% - Real wage falls from \\(50,000/\\)P_0$ to \\(50,000/\\)P_1$ - This real adjustment allows labour markets to clear during downturns\nWith zero inflation target: - If real wages must fall to clear the labour market, firms must negotiate nominal wage cuts - Workers resist, unemployment persists - The economy cannot efficiently adjust to shocks\nThis is particularly important during periods of high unemployment when downward pressure on real wages would normally help restore labour market equilibrium.\nSummary of Three Problems\n\nDeflation risk → monetary policy becomes ineffective (zero lower bound)\nInterest rate constraint → less room to stimulate during recessions\nWage rigidity → real wage adjustment becomes harder, prolonging unemployment\n\nMost central banks target 2% inflation as a compromise: high enough to provide a buffer against deflation and interest rate constraints, yet low enough to maintain price stability."

    "text": "Tip\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Primary Instrument: The Policy (Base) Interest Rate\nThe policy rate (also called the base rate or overnight rate) is the interest rate at which the central bank lends short-term funds—typically overnight—to commercial banks. Major central banks (Federal Reserve, ECB, Bank of England, etc.) set this rate as their primary policy instrument.\nThe Three Main Transmission Channels\nChanges in the policy rate affect inflation through three distinct channels:\n\n\nThis is the gradual transmission through the financial system:\n\nInterbank markets: When the CB raises the policy rate, banks paying higher overnight rates pass increased costs through the interbank lending market\nMoney market rates: Rates on commercial paper, certificates of deposit, and other money market instruments rise\nBank lending rates: Banks increase rates on mortgages, business loans, and consumer credit\nFirm and household decisions: Higher borrowing costs cause:\n\nFirms to cut investment (returns lower relative to borrowing cost)\nHouseholds to reduce consumption (especially discretionary spending and home purchases)\n\nGoods and labour markets: Reduced spending decreases demand for goods and labour\nWages and prices: Lower labour demand reduces wage growth; reduced goods demand reduces price growth\n\nEffect on inflation: Slower growth in wages and prices → lower inflation\n\n\n\nThis works through central bank communication and expectations:\n\nCB signals intent: When the CB raises the policy rate, it signals that it intends to bring inflation down\nForward guidance: The CB may explicitly state that rates will remain high until inflation targets are met\nWage and price setter expectations: Workers and firms, believing inflation will fall, moderate their own wage and price demands\nImmediate effect: Even before spending contracts significantly, inflation expectations fall because wage and price setters anticipate lower inflation ahead\nSelf-fulfilling: As workers accept lower nominal wage growth and firms set lower prices (expecting lower future inflation), inflation actually falls faster\n\nEffect on inflation: Faster reduction in inflation through expectation management and forward guidance\n\n\n\nThis works through international financial flows:\n\nHigher domestic rates: The CB raises the policy rate\nCapital attraction: Higher returns attract foreign investment seeking yield\nCurrency appreciation: Increased foreign demand for the domestic currency causes it to appreciate\nLower import prices: An appreciated currency makes foreign goods cheaper in domestic terms (e.g., if the dollar appreciates, US importers pay fewer dollars for foreign goods)\nReduced inflation: Cheaper imports directly lower consumer price indices and reduce inflationary pressure from import costs\nCompetitiveness effect: Appreciated currency also makes domestic exports more expensive abroad, reducing external demand and further dampening inflation\n\nEffect on inflation: Through lower import prices and reduced external demand\n\nDiagram: Monetary Policy Transmission Channels\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nWarning: package 'ggplot2' was built under R version

    "text": "Tip\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Four Shocks to the UK Economy\n\n\nThe eurozone faced a sovereign debt crisis starting with Greece, spreading to Ireland, Portugal, Spain, and Italy. This created spillover effects to the UK through: - Trade linkages (reduced eurozone demand for UK exports) - Financial linkages (UK banks had exposure to eurozone debt) - Confidence effects (risk aversion reduced cross-border investment)\nBoE Response: The BoE maintained historically low interest rates and expanded quantitative easing (QE) programs to support the UK economy while eurozone policy was constrained by fiscal austerity rules. The BoE provided expansionary support independently because eurozone central banks were pursuing tight policy.\n\n\n\nThe June 2016 Brexit referendum vote to leave the European Union created significant uncertainty: - Currency depreciation (pound fell ~10-15% post-vote) - Investment uncertainty (businesses delayed capital expenditure) - Consumer confidence shocks (expectations of job losses, inflation)\nBoE Response: Initially, the BoE cut rates and restarted QE post-referendum to support growth. However, the BoE also faced an inflation problem from currency depreciation, creating a policy dilemma. The BoE provided expansionary policy while managing inflation expectations—again, largely acting alone as other central banks weren’t facing similar shocks.\n\n\n\nThe global pandemic induced the sharpest recession in modern times: - Lockdowns shut down large parts of the economy - Unemployment spiked sharply - Output fell ~20% in Q2 2020 - Financial markets experienced severe stress and illiquidity\nBoE Response: This was unprecedented in scale and speed. The BoE: - Cut rates to near-zero (0.1%) almost immediately - Expanded QE programs dramatically (£200+ billion purchases) - Introduced lending facilities to support credit to businesses (CCFF, CBILS) - Coordinated with other major central banks (Fed, ECB) and governments\nKey difference from 2007: Unlike the initial 2007 response (gradual rate cuts over time), the 2020 response was immediate, large-scale, and multi-dimensional. Importantly, this was coordinated with other major central banks and fiscal authorities, not a unilateral BoE response.\n\n\n\nAs COVID restrictions lifted: - Pent-up demand rebounded sharply - Supply chains remained disrupted - Energy prices surged dramatically (Russian invasion of Ukraine, OPEC+ production cuts) - Inflation rose from 1-2% to 10%+ (October 2022 peak)\nBoE Response: Facing generational high inflation, the BoE: - Raised rates from near-zero to 5.25% by August 2023 (fastest pace in decades) - Ended QE and began quantitative tightening (selling assets) - Communicated aggressively about inflation-fighting credentials - Accepted that output would fall and unemployment would rise to bring inflation down\n\nComparison with 2007 Initial Response\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAspect\n2007 Response\nPost-2010 Response\n\n\n\n\nSpeed\nGradual rate cuts over time\nRapid, sometimes immediate\n\n\nScope\nTraditional monetary policy (interest rates, eventually QE)\nMulti-faceted: rates + QE + lending facilities + forward guidance\n\n\nCoordination\nLargely unilateral BoE action\nCoordinated with other CBs and governments (especially 2020)\n\n\nReal economy focus\nInitially focused on financial stability, gradual real economy support\nExplicitly directed at real economy support and employment (especially post-2010)\n\n\nCommunication\nLess explicit about objectives and timelines\nHighly transparent about objectives, timelines, and policy frameworks\n\n\nFlexibility\nRigid adherence to inflation targeting initially\nContext-dependent: inflation targets maintained but balanced against real economy needs\n\n\n\nKey Insight: The BoE’s response evolved from a narrow focus on inflation stability (2007) toward a more holistic approach to economic stability, explicitly supporting real economy activity, and actively communicating its intentions. The BoE set aside the part of the Great Moderation consensus that suggested central banks should focus exclusively on inflation—while maintaining the emphasis on transparency and communication.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Great Moderation Consensus\nBefore the Great Recession, there was a dominant monetary policy consensus built on two pillars:\n\nInflation Stability = Overall Economic Stability: Central banks’ primary focus should be maintaining low and stable inflation. The logic was that this would promote overall macroeconomic stability, financial stability, and sustainable growth.\nThe Policy Framework: The appropriate tool for achieving this is interest rate targeting (typically an inflation target of ~2%), using the policy rate as the main instrument, with the assumption that markets would function efficiently and transmission mechanisms would operate reliably.\n\nThis consensus reflected the belief that: - Central banks should have a single, narrow mandate (price stability) - Financial markets self-correct through rational expectations - There are no trade-offs between inflation stability and other macro objectives - Central banks should be independent but accountable for inflation performance\nHow Post-Great Recession Policy Challenged This\n\n\nThe Problem: Following the 2008 crash, the Fed, ECB, and BoE cut rates to near-zero. But the economy remained depressed—unemployment stayed high, growth remained sluggish, and inflation fell below target. Traditional monetary policy had “run out of ammunition.”\nThe Modification: Central banks adopted quantitative easing (QE)—direct purchases of long-term securities to inject liquidity and lower longer-term rates. This represented an admission that: - The policy interest rate alone may not be sufficient, especially at the zero lower bound - Central banks must be willing to use unconventional tools when conventional tools are exhausted - Central bank balance sheets and asset purchases matter for inflation and output\nImplication: The narrow focus on the policy interest rate as the main lever was abandoned in favour of a broader toolkit that includes QE, forward guidance, negative rates (in some countries), and lending facilities.\n\n\n\nThe Problem: The 2008 crisis demonstrated that you can have price stability yet face a severe recession. Inflation was tame (~2%) before the crash, yet the financial system nearly collapsed and real output fell sharply.\nThe Modification: Central banks acknowledged that: - Financial stability must be a separate objective alongside price stability - Macro-prudential regulation (capital requirements, stress testing, countercyclical buffers) should complement monetary policy - Central banks must monitor financial imbalances, credit growth, and asset price bubbles—not just inflation - A single-minded focus on inflation targeting can miss risks to overall economic stability\nImplication: Central banks began explicitly incorporating financial stability considerations into their policy frameworks, even when this meant accepting higher inflation temporarily to support financial stability or real activity.\n\n\n\nThe Problem: The Great Moderation consensus emphasized inflation targeting as a permanent, non-negotiable commitment. But different shocks and different circumstances may require different priorities: - During the eurozone crisis, unemployment was high; inflation was low. Focusing rigidly on inflation targets would have meant tighter policy, worsening unemployment - During COVID, the initial priority was financial stability and preventing economic collapse, not hitting inflation targets - During post-COVID inflation, unemployment was low; inflation was high.

    "text": "Tip\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Four Shocks to the UK Economy\n\n\nThe eurozone faced a sovereign debt crisis starting with Greece, spreading to Ireland, Portugal, Spain, and Italy. This created spillover effects to the UK through: - Trade linkages (reduced eurozone demand for UK exports) - Financial linkages (UK banks had exposure to eurozone debt) - Confidence effects (risk aversion reduced cross-border investment)\nBoE Response: The BoE maintained historically low interest rates and expanded quantitative easing (QE) programs to support the UK economy while eurozone policy was constrained by fiscal austerity rules. The BoE provided expansionary support independently because eurozone central banks were pursuing tight policy.\n\n\n\nThe June 2016 Brexit referendum vote to leave the European Union created significant uncertainty: - Currency depreciation (pound fell ~10-15% post-vote) - Investment uncertainty (businesses delayed capital expenditure) - Consumer confidence shocks (expectations of job losses, inflation)\nBoE Response: Initially, the BoE cut rates and restarted QE post-referendum to support growth. However, the BoE also faced an inflation problem from currency depreciation, creating a policy dilemma. The BoE provided expansionary policy while managing inflation expectations—again, largely acting alone as other central banks weren’t facing similar shocks.\n\n\n\nThe global pandemic induced the sharpest recession in modern times: - Lockdowns shut down large parts of the economy - Unemployment spiked sharply - Output fell ~20% in Q2 2020 - Financial markets experienced severe stress and illiquidity\nBoE Response: This was unprecedented in scale and speed. The BoE: - Cut rates to near-zero (0.1%) almost immediately - Expanded QE programs dramatically (£200+ billion purchases) - Introduced lending facilities to support credit to businesses (CCFF, CBILS) - Coordinated with other major central banks (Fed, ECB) and governments\nKey difference from 2007: Unlike the initial 2007 response (gradual rate cuts over time), the 2020 response was immediate, large-scale, and multi-dimensional. Importantly, this was coordinated with other major central banks and fiscal authorities, not a unilateral BoE response.\n\n\n\nAs COVID restrictions lifted: - Pent-up demand rebounded sharply - Supply chains remained disrupted - Energy prices surged dramatically (Russian invasion of Ukraine, OPEC+ production cuts) - Inflation rose from 1-2% to 10%+ (October 2022 peak)\nBoE Response: Facing generational high inflation, the BoE: - Raised rates from near-zero to 5.25% by August 2023 (fastest pace in decades) - Ended QE and began quantitative tightening (selling assets) - Communicated aggressively about inflation-fighting credentials - Accepted that output would fall and unemployment would rise to bring inflation down\n\nComparison with 2007 Initial Response\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAspect\n2007 Response\nPost-2010 Response\n\n\n\n\nSpeed\nGradual rate cuts over time\nRapid, sometimes immediate\n\n\nScope\nTraditional monetary policy (interest rates, eventually QE)\nMulti-faceted: rates + QE + lending facilities + forward guidance\n\n\nCoordination\nLargely unilateral BoE action\nCoordinated with other CBs and governments (especially 2020)\n\n\nReal economy focus\nInitially focused on financial stability, gradual real economy support\nExplicitly directed at real economy support and employment (especially post-2010)\n\n\nCommunication\nLess explicit about objectives and timelines\nHighly transparent about objectives, timelines, and policy frameworks\n\n\nFlexibility\nRigid adherence to inflation targeting initially\nContext-dependent: inflation targets maintained but balanced against real economy needs\n\n\n\nKey Insight: The BoE’s response evolved from a narrow focus on inflation stability (2007) toward a more holistic approach to economic stability, explicitly supporting real economy activity, and actively communicating its intentions. The BoE set aside the part of the Great Moderation consensus that suggested central banks should focus exclusively on inflation—while maintaining the emphasis on transparency and communication."

    "text": "Tip\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Great Moderation Consensus\nBefore the Great Recession, there was a dominant monetary policy consensus built on two pillars:\n\nInflation Stability = Overall Economic Stability: Central banks’ primary focus should be maintaining low and stable inflation. The logic was that this would promote overall macroeconomic stability, financial stability, and sustainable growth.\nThe Policy Framework: The appropriate tool for achieving this is interest rate targeting (typically an inflation target of ~2%), using the policy rate as the main instrument, with the assumption that markets would function efficiently and transmission mechanisms would operate reliably.\n\nThis consensus reflected the belief that: - Central banks should have a single, narrow mandate (price stability) - Financial markets self-correct through rational expectations - There are no trade-offs between inflation stability and other macro objectives - Central banks should be independent but accountable for inflation performance\nHow Post-Great Recession Policy Challenged This\n\n\nThe Problem: Following the 2008 crash, the Fed, ECB, and BoE cut rates to near-zero. But the economy remained depressed—unemployment stayed high, growth remained sluggish, and inflation fell below target. Traditional monetary policy had “run out of ammunition.”\nThe Modification: Central banks adopted quantitative easing (QE)—direct purchases of long-term securities to inject liquidity and lower longer-term rates. This represented an admission that: - The policy interest rate alone may not be sufficient, especially at the zero lower bound - Central banks must be willing to use unconventional tools when conventional tools are exhausted - Central bank balance sheets and asset purchases matter for inflation and output\nImplication: The narrow focus on the policy interest rate as the main lever was abandoned in favour of a broader toolkit that includes QE, forward guidance, negative rates (in some countries), and lending facilities.\n\n\n\nThe Problem: The 2008 crisis demonstrated that you can have price stability yet face a severe recession. Inflation was tame (~2%) before the crash, yet the financial system nearly collapsed and real output fell sharply.\nThe Modification: Central banks acknowledged that: - Financial stability must be a separate objective alongside price stability - Macro-prudential regulation (capital requirements, stress testing, countercyclical buffers) should complement monetary policy - Central banks must monitor financial imbalances, credit growth, and asset price bubbles—not just inflation - A single-minded focus on inflation targeting can miss risks to overall economic stability\nImplication: Central banks began explicitly incorporating financial stability considerations into their policy frameworks, even when this meant accepting higher inflation temporarily to support financial stability or real activity.\n\n\n\nThe Problem: The Great Moderation consensus emphasized inflation targeting as a permanent, non-negotiable commitment. But different shocks and different circumstances may require different priorities: - During the eurozone crisis, unemployment was high; inflation was low. Focusing rigidly on inflation targets would have meant tighter policy, worsening unemployment - During COVID, the initial priority was financial stability and preventing economic collapse, not hitting inflation targets - During post-COVID inflation, unemployment was low; inflation was high. The balance shifted toward fighting inflation\nThe Modification: Central banks adopted a more flexible, pragmatic approach where: - The inflation target remains the long-run anchor, but the policy timeline is flexible - Real economy considerations (employment, growth) are balanced against inflation, not subordinated to it - Communication is explicit about trade-offs and priorities given the current shock - Forward guidance and transparency substitute for rigid rules\nImplication: Modern central banking is more discretionary than the Great Moderation consensus suggested. The consensus view that “rules are better than discretion” gave way to “credible discretion with transparent communication.”\n\n\n\nThe Problem: The Great Moderation consensus implied narrow independence: central banks should focus on inflation, period.
