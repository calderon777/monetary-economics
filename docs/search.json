    "text": "How to use this quiz\n\n\n\nThis quiz is designed as a formative self-assessment tool, not as a test.\nIts purpose is to help you: - check your understanding of the key concepts from Topic 1, - identify which types of thinking you find more difficult, and - guide your revision before the tutorial and future assessments.\n\n\nEach question belongs to one of four categories:\n\nSubject Knowledge (SK): definitions, concepts, and facts.\n\nAnalysis (AN): understanding relationships and economic mechanisms.\n\nProblem Solving (PS): applying concepts to new situations.\n\nMathematical Thinking (MT): working with ratios, prices, and scaling.\n\nYour score will be broken down by category so you can see where you are strong and where you need more practice.\n\n\n\n\nYou may use your notes and the lecture materials.\nTake your time — the goal is understanding, not speed.\nUse the Hints if you get stuck.\nYou may refresh and retry the quiz as many times as you like.\n\n\n\n\n\nA low score is not a problem — it tells you what to focus on.\nIf you score low in:\n\nSK: revise definitions and core concepts.\nAN: revisit the logic of the models and examples.\nPS: practise applying concepts to new cases.\nMT: practise the price and ratio calculations.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe leaderboard is optional and anonymous. It exists only to make practice more engaging.\nIt has no effect on your grade and is not used for evaluation.\nThe only purpose of this quiz is to support your learning."
