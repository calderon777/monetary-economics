**Learning objectives (before you start):**
- Identify the core concept in each question and state it explicitly.
- Apply economic reasoning (not just examples) to justify your answers.
- Explain the "why", not just the "what", for every claim you make.

**How to use the AI tutor:**
1) Write your own answer first.
2) Click **Get AI Feedback** and note what you got right or missed.
3) Revise your answer in your notes; be explicit with definitions and causal reasoning.
4) **During tutorial:** Your human tutor will probe, challenge, and help you rephrase your reasoning. *The tutor is your primary feedback source.* AI is a starting point only.

⚠️ **Important:** AI models can hallucinate or produce plausible-sounding but incorrect explanations. Always verify claims against lecture notes and textbooks. Bring your AI-drafted answer to tutorial for tutor feedback—don't treat AI suggestions as definitive.

## Questions on Topic 2 - Classical Theory of Money

### Question 1: Utility Maximization

Consider a trader who derives utility from two goods, 1 and 2. Her utility function is given by

$$U = d_1^{\alpha} d_2^{1-\alpha}$$

where $d_1$ is her demand for good 1 and $d_2$ is her demand for good 2; $\alpha$ is a parameter that lies between 0 and 1.

Her initial endowment is $s_1 \geq 0$ units of good 1 and $s_2 \geq 0$ units of good 2.

**(a)** Suppose that the nominal price of good 1 is $P_1$ and that of good 2 is $P_2$. Write an expression for her nominal "income" $y_N$.

**(b)** Write her budget constraint as a function of the price of each good, her demand of each good and her nominal income $y_N$.

**(c)** She maximises her utility function subject to the budget constraint. Write down her utility maximisation problem and derive the first-order conditions.

**(d)** Solve for her demands of each good $d_1$, $d_2$ as functions of $P_1$, $P_2$ and $y_N$.

**(e)** Now express her demands $d_1$, $d_2$ as functions of $P_1$, $P_2$, $s_1$ and $s_2$. What happens to her demands if all prices double?

**(f)** Suppose $s_1 = 2$, $s_2 = 10$, $P_1 = 2$, $P_2 = 1$, and $\alpha = 0.5$. What will be her *net purchase* of each good. Note: A net purchase is the difference between the amount she demands of each good and the amount she had in her endowment.

### Indicative Answer to Question 1

**(a)** Nominal income:
$$y_N = P_1 s_1 + P_2 s_2$$

**(b)** Budget constraint:
$$P_1 d_1 + P_2 d_2 = y_N$$

**(c)** Utility maximisation problem:
$$\mathcal{L} = d_1^{\alpha} d_2^{1-\alpha} + \lambda[y_N - P_1 d_1 - P_2 d_2]$$

First-order conditions:
$$\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial d_1} = \alpha \left(\frac{d_2}{d_1}\right)^{1-\alpha} - \lambda P_1 = 0$$
$$\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial d_2} = (1-\alpha) \left(\frac{d_1}{d_2}\right)^{\alpha} - \lambda P_2 = 0$$
$$\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \lambda} = y_N - P_1 d_1 - P_2 d_2 = 0$$

**(d)** Combining FOCs for $d_1$ and $d_2$:
$$\lambda = \frac{\alpha}{P_1}\left(\frac{d_2}{d_1}\right)^{1-\alpha} = \frac{(1-\alpha)}{P_2}\left(\frac{d_1}{d_2}\right)^{\alpha}$$

Rearranging:
$$\frac{d_2}{d_1} = \frac{(1-\alpha)}{\alpha} \frac{P_1}{P_2}$$
$$d_2 = \left[\frac{(1-\alpha)}{\alpha} \frac{P_1}{P_2}\right] d_1$$

Plugging into the budget constraint:
$$P_1 d_1 + P_2 \left[\frac{(1-\alpha)}{\alpha} \frac{P_1}{P_2}\right] d_1 = y_N$$
$$P_1 d_1 \left[1 + \frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}\right] = y_N$$
$$P_1 d_1 \left[\frac{\alpha + 1 - \alpha}{\alpha}\right] = y_N$$

Therefore:
$$d_1^* = \alpha \frac{y_N}{P_1}$$
$$d_2^* = (1-\alpha) \frac{y_N}{P_2}$$

These represent optimal choices of $d_1$, $d_2$.

**(e)** Expanding $y_N$:
$$d_1^* = \alpha \left[\frac{P_1 s_1 + P_2 s_2}{P_1}\right] = \alpha\left[s_1 + \frac{P_2}{P_1}s_2\right]$$
$$d_2^* = (1-\alpha)\left[\frac{P_1 s_1 + P_2 s_2}{P_2}\right] = (1-\alpha)\left[\frac{P_1}{P_2}s_1 + s_2\right]$$

If $P_1$, $P_2$ double, $\frac{P_1}{P_2}$ and $\frac{P_2}{P_1}$ are unaffected.

So $d_1^*$, $d_2^*$ unchanged, reflecting the homogeneity of demand functions.

**(f)** Plugging in $s_1 = 2$, $s_2 = 10$, $P_1 = 2$, $P_2 = 1$, $\alpha = 0.5$:
$$d_1^* = 0.5\left[2 + \frac{1}{2}(10)\right] = 0.5[2 + 5] = 3.5$$
$$d_2^* = 0.5\left[\frac{2}{1}(2) + 10\right] = 0.5[4 + 10] = 7$$

Net purchase:
$$d_1^* - s_1 = 3.5 - 2 = 1.5 \text{ (net purchase of good 1)}$$
$$d_2^* - s_2 = 7 - 10 = -3 \text{ (net sale of good 2)}$$

Note that net purchase of 1 = net sale of 2 in value terms.

### Question 2: General Equilibrium in an Exchange Economy

Consider an exchange economy with 2 traders, $A$ and $B$ and 2 goods, 1 and 2. The nominal price of each good is $P_1$ and $P_2$ respectively.

Suppose that each trader has the following endowment of each good:

$$s^A = (s_1^A, s_2^A)$$
$$s^B = (s_1^B, s_2^B)$$

where $s_j^i \geq 0$ for $i = A, B$ and $j = 1, 2$.

Let $d_1^A$, $d_2^A$ represent agent $A$'s demand for each of the two goods and $d_1^B$, $d_2^B$ likewise for agent $B$. Suppose that each agent's endowment is exogenous but her demand for each good is a function of its relative price.

**(a)** Write down each agent's budget constraint in (i) nominal terms and (ii) in real terms, using good 1 as a numeraire (*i.e.* unit of account).

**(b)** Write down the market clearing condition for each good (Note: The demand for each good by each agent will be expressed as a function of the relative price of $P_2/P_1$ and her real income evaluated in equivalent units of good 1).

**(c)** Show that when: (i) each agent's budget constraint is binding (*i.e.* their total spending exactly equals their real income) (ii) the market for good 1 is in equilibrium, then the market for good 2 is also bound to be in equilibrium. What 'law' have you illustrated?

### Indicative Answer to Question 2

**(a)** Budget constraints:

**Nominal budget constraints:**

Agent A: $P_1 d_1^{A*} + P_2 d_2^{A*} \leq P_1 s_1^A + P_2 s_2^A$

Agent B: $P_1 d_1^{B*} + P_2 d_2^{B*} \leq P_1 s_1^B + P_2 s_2^B$

**Real terms (using good 1 as numeraire):**

Agent A: $d_1^{A*} + \frac{P_2}{P_1} d_2^{A*} \leq s_1^A + \frac{P_2}{P_1} s_2^A$

Agent B: $d_1^{B*} + \frac{P_2}{P_1} d_2^{B*} \leq s_1^B + \frac{P_2}{P_1} s_2^B$

where demands are functions of relative price and real income:
$$d_1^{A*} = d_1^A\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}, \frac{y_N^A}{P_1}\right), \quad d_2^{A*} = d_2^A\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}, \frac{y_N^A}{P_1}\right)$$
$$d_1^{B*} = d_1^B\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}, \frac{y_N^B}{P_1}\right), \quad d_2^{B*} = d_2^B\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}, \frac{y_N^B}{P_1}\right)$$

**(b)** Market clearing conditions (total purchases = total sales):

**Good 1:** $d_1^{A*} + d_1^{B*} = s_1^A + s_1^B \Rightarrow D_1 = S_1$

**Good 2:** $d_2^{A*} + d_2^{B*} = s_2^A + s_2^B \Rightarrow D_2 = S_2$

**(c)** Suppose $D_1 = S_1$, assume that the budget constraint of each agent holds as "=" (binding), then only the real ones need to be looked at:

$$d_1^{A*} + \frac{P_2}{P_1} d_2^{A*} + d_1^{B*} + \frac{P_2}{P_1} d_2^{B*} = s_1^A + \frac{P_2}{P_1}s_2^A + s_1^B + \frac{P_2}{P_1}s_2^B$$

Rearranging:
$$\underbrace{(d_1^{A*} + d_1^{B*})}_{A} + \frac{P_2}{P_1}\underbrace{(d_2^{A*} + d_2^{B*})}_{B} = \underbrace{(s_1^A + s_1^B)}_{A} + \frac{P_2}{P_1}\underbrace{(s_2^A + s_2^B)}_{B}$$

Since $D_1 = S_1$ (market for good 1 clears), terms A cancel:
$$\frac{P_2}{P_1}(d_2^{A*} + d_2^{B*}) = \frac{P_2}{P_1}(s_2^A + s_2^B)$$
$$\therefore D_2 = S_2$$

**This establishes Walras' Law**: If $n-1$ markets clear and all budget constraints bind, the $n$-th market must also clear.

**Reflection after you reveal an indicative answer:**
- What did you miss? Where was your reasoning thin?
- Rewrite one stronger sentence that uses an explicit definition + a clear "because".

**About indicative answers:**
Indicative answers will be released *after* your tutorial. They are explicitly **not** model answers—they illustrate one acceptable line of reasoning. Your tutorial discussion and your own reasoning remain primary.
