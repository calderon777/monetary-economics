## Questions on Topic 2 - Classical Theory of Money

These questions focus on utility maximization, budget constraints, and general equilibrium in exchange economies.

### Question 1: Utility Maximization

Consider a trader who derives utility from two goods, 1 and 2. Her utility function is given by

$$U = d_1^{\alpha} d_2^{1-\alpha}$$

where $d_1$ is her demand for good 1 and $d_2$ is her demand of good 2; $\alpha$ is a parameter that lies between 0 and 1.

Her initial endowment is $s_1 \geq 0$ units of good 1 and $s_2 \geq 0$ units of good 2.

**(a)** Suppose that the nominal price of good 1 is $P_1$ and that of good 2 is $P_2$. Write an expression for her nominal "income" $y_N$.

**(b)** Write her budget constraint as a function of the price of each good, her demand of each good and her nominal income $y_N$.

**(c)** She maximises her utility function subject to the budget constraint. Write down her utility maximisation problem and derive the first-order conditions.

**(d)** Solve for her demands of each good $d_1$, $d_2$ as functions of $P_1$, $P_2$ and $y_N$.

**(e)** Now express her demands $d_1$, $d_2$ as functions of $P_1$, $P_2$, $s_1$ and $s_2$. What happens to her demands if all prices double?

**(f)** Suppose $s_1 = 2$, $s_2 = 10$, $P_1 = 2$, $P_2 = 1$, and $\alpha = 0.5$. What will be her *net purchase* of each good. Note: A net purchase is the difference between the amount she demands of each good and the amount she had in her endowment.

### Indicative Answer to Question 1

**(a)** Nominal income:
$$y_N = P_1 s_1 + P_2 s_2$$

**(b)** Budget constraint:
$$P_1 d_1 + P_2 d_2 = y_N$$

**(c)** Utility maximisation problem:
$$\mathcal{L} = d_1^{\alpha} d_2^{1-\alpha} + \lambda[y_N - P_1 d_1 - P_2 d_2]$$

First-order conditions:
$$\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial d_1} = \alpha \left(\frac{d_2}{d_1}\right)^{1-\alpha} - \lambda P_1 = 0$$
$$\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial d_2} = (1-\alpha) \left(\frac{d_1}{d_2}\right)^{\alpha} - \lambda P_2 = 0$$
$$\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \lambda} = y_N - P_1 d_1 - P_2 d_2 = 0$$

**(d)** Combining FOCs for $d_1$ and $d_2$:
$$\lambda = \frac{\alpha}{P_1}\left(\frac{d_2}{d_1}\right)^{1-\alpha} = \frac{(1-\alpha)}{P_2}\left(\frac{d_1}{d_2}\right)^{\alpha}$$

Rearranging:
$$\frac{d_2}{d_1} = \frac{(1-\alpha)}{\alpha} \frac{P_1}{P_2}$$
$$d_2 = \left[\frac{(1-\alpha)}{\alpha} \frac{P_1}{P_2}\right] d_1$$

Plugging into the budget constraint:
$$P_1 d_1 + P_2 \left[\frac{(1-\alpha)}{\alpha} \frac{P_1}{P_2}\right] d_1 = y_N$$
$$P_1 d_1 \left[1 + \frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}\right] = y_N$$
$$P_1 d_1 \left[\frac{\alpha + 1 - \alpha}{\alpha}\right] = y_N$$

Therefore:
$$d_1^* = \alpha \frac{y_N}{P_1}$$
$$d_2^* = (1-\alpha) \frac{y_N}{P_2}$$

These represent optimal choices of $d_1$, $d_2$.

**(e)** Expanding $y_N$:
$$d_1^* = \alpha \left[\frac{P_1 s_1 + P_2 s_2}{P_1}\right] = \alpha[s_1 + \frac{P_2}{P_1}s_2]$$
$$d_2^* = (1-\alpha)\left[\frac{P_1 s_1 + P_2 s_2}{P_2}\right] = (1-\alpha)[\frac{P_1}{P_2}s_1 + s_2]$$

If $P_1$, $P_2$ double, $\frac{P_1}{P_2}$ and $\frac{P_2}{P_1}$ are unaffected.

So $d_1^*$, $d_2^*$ unchanged, reflecting the homogeneity of demand functions.

**(f)** Plugging in $s_1 = 2$, $s_2 = 10$, $P_1 = 2$, $P_2 = 1$, $\alpha = 0.5$:
$$d_1^* = 0.5\left[2 + \frac{1}{2}(10)\right] = 0.5[2 + 5] = 3.5$$
$$d_2^* = 0.5\left[\frac{2}{1}(2) + 10\right] = 0.5[4 + 10] = 7$$

Net purchase:
$$d_1^* - s_1 = 3.5 - 2 = 1.5 \text{ (net purchase of good 1)}$$
$$d_2^* - s_2 = 7 - 10 = -3 \text{ (net sale of good 2)}$$

Note that net purchase of 1 = net sale of 2 in value terms.

### Question 2: General Equilibrium in an Exchange Economy

Consider an exchange economy with 2 traders, $A$ and $B$ and 2 goods, 1 and 2. The nominal price of each good is $P_1$ and $P_2$ respectively.

Suppose that each trader has the following endowment of each good:

$$s^A = (s_1^A, s_2^A)$$
$$s^B = (s_1^B, s_2^B)$$

where $s_j^i \geq 0$ for $i = A, B$ and $j = 1, 2$.

Let $d_1^A$, $d_2^A$ represent agent $A$'s demand for each of the two goods and $d_1^B$, $d_2^B$ likewise for agent $B$. Suppose that each agent's endowment is exogenous but her demand for each good is a function of its relative price.

**(a)** Write down each agent's budget constraint in (i) nominal terms and (ii) in real terms, using good 1 as a numeraire (*i.e.* unit of account).

**(b)** Write down the market clearing condition for each good (Note: The demand for each good by each agent will be expressed as a function of the relative price of $P_2/P_1$ and her real income evaluated in equivalent units of good 1).

**(c)** Show that when: (i) each agent's budget constraint is binding (*i.e.* their total spending exactly equals their real income) (ii) the market for good 1 is in equilibrium, then the market for good 2 is also bound to be in equilibrium. What 'law' have you illustrated?

### Indicative Answer to Question 2

**(a)** Budget constraints:

**Nominal budget constraints:**

Agent A: $P_1 d_1^{A*} + P_2 d_2^{A*} \leq P_1 s_1^A + P_2 s_2^A$

Agent B: $P_1 d_1^{B*} + P_2 d_2^{B*} \leq P_1 s_1^B + P_2 s_2^B$

**Real terms (using good 1 as numeraire):**

Agent A: $d_1^{A*} + \frac{P_2}{P_1} d_2^{A*} \leq s_1^A + \frac{P_2}{P_1} s_2^A$

Agent B: $d_1^{B*} + \frac{P_2}{P_1} d_2^{B*} \leq s_1^B + \frac{P_2}{P_1} s_2^B$

where demands are functions of relative price and real income:
$$d_1^{A*} = d_1^A\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}, \frac{y_N^A}{P_1}\right), \quad d_2^{A*} = d_2^A\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}, \frac{y_N^A}{P_1}\right)$$
$$d_1^{B*} = d_1^B\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}, \frac{y_N^B}{P_1}\right), \quad d_2^{B*} = d_2^B\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}, \frac{y_N^B}{P_1}\right)$$

**(b)** Market clearing conditions (total purchases = total sales):

**Good 1:** $d_1^{A*} + d_1^{B*} = s_1^A + s_1^B \Rightarrow D_1 = S_1$

**Good 2:** $d_2^{A*} + d_2^{B*} = s_2^A + s_2^B \Rightarrow D_2 = S_2$

**(c)** Suppose $D_1 = S_1$, assume that the budget constraint of each agent holds as "=" (binding), then only the real ones need to be looked at:

$$d_1^{A*} + \frac{P_2}{P_1} d_2^{A*} + d_1^{B*} + \frac{P_2}{P_1} d_2^{B*} = s_1^A + \frac{P_2}{P_1}s_2^A + s_1^B + \frac{P_2}{P_1}s_2^B$$

Rearranging:
$$\underbrace{(d_1^{A*} + d_1^{B*})}_{A} + \frac{P_2}{P_1}\underbrace{(d_2^{A*} + d_2^{B*})}_{B} = \underbrace{(s_1^A + s_1^B)}_{A} + \frac{P_2}{P_1}\underbrace{(s_2^A + s_2^B)}_{B}$$

Since $D_1 = S_1$ (market for good 1 clears), terms A cancel:
$$\frac{P_2}{P_1}(d_2^{A*} + d_2^{B*}) = \frac{P_2}{P_1}(s_2^A + s_2^B)$$
$$\therefore D_2 = S_2$$

**This establishes Walras' Law**: If $n-1$ markets clear and all budget constraints bind, the $n$-th market must also clear.

## Reflection Questions

After working through these questions:

1. How does the homogeneity property of demand functions reflect the classical theory's view on money neutrality?
2. Why is Walras' Law important for general equilibrium analysis?
3. How do budget constraints in real vs nominal terms help us understand the role of relative prices?
