## Interactive Tutorial with AI Feedback

Use this page to practise **concept clarity** and **economic reasoning** before your tutorial.

**Learning objectives (before you start):**
- Identify the core concept in each question and state it explicitly.
- Apply economic reasoning (not just examples) to justify your answers.
- Explain the “why”, not just the “what”, for every claim you make.

**How to use the AI tutor:**
1) Write your own answer first.
2) Click **Get AI Feedback** and note what you got right or missed.
3) Revise your answer in your notes; be explicit with definitions and causal reasoning.
4) **During tutorial:** Your human tutor will probe, challenge, and help you rephrase your reasoning. *The tutor is your primary feedback source.* AI is a starting point only.

⚠️ **Important:** AI models can hallucinate or produce plausible-sounding but incorrect explanations. Always verify claims against lecture notes and textbooks. Bring your AI-drafted answer to tutorial for tutor feedback—don't treat AI suggestions as definitive.

**About indicative answers:**
Indicative answers will be released *after* your tutorial. They are explicitly **not** model answers—they illustrate one acceptable line of reasoning. Your tutorial discussion and your own reasoning remain primary.

**Reflection after you reveal an indicative answer:**
- What did you miss? Where was your reasoning thin?
- Rewrite one stronger sentence that uses an explicit definition + a clear “because”.

## Tutor Commentary

### Common Misconceptions Observed

**Question 1 (MoE → SoV → UoA):**
- Students often conflate "automatic" with "necessary". SoV follows from MoE *in practice* (time gap), but students sometimes suggest all three roles are equally entangled.
- UoA independence is frequently overlooked; students default to assuming MoE is always UoA.

**Question 2 (Liquidity characteristics):**
- Students list the four attributes but struggle to connect them causally. They state "marketability matters" without explaining *why* it generates liquidity.
- Physical attributes are sometimes confused with economic attributes; e.g., "gold is valuable" vs. "gold is transportable and durable, which enables it to be valuable as MoE."

**Question 3 (Three-trader alternatives):**
- Students often propose clearinghouse as a general solution without acknowledging search costs or information requirements.
- The conclusion about MoE simplifying coordination is stated but not *derived* from the example's complexity.

### Good Reasoning Patterns to Highlight

- Explicit causal chains: "Because there is a time gap between sale and purchase, money *must store value*."
- Contrasts between concepts: "Unlike MoE, which requires universal acceptance, UoA only requires shared definition."
- Links to real examples with reasoning: "SDR shows UoA can exist without MoE because it's used for accounting, not transactions."

### Links to Exam Expectations

- **Exam-style framing:** Questions will test whether you can *defend* a position using economic logic, not just list definitions.
- **Marking focus:** Marks are awarded for reasoning (causal links, scope limitations) more than for correct labels.
- **Common traps:** Overgeneralizing from one context (e.g., "all money serves all three roles everywhere") without qualification.
