## Interactive Tutorial with AI Feedback

Use this page to practise **concept clarity** and **economic reasoning** before your tutorial.

**Learning objectives (before you start):**
- Identify the core concept in each question and state it explicitly.
- Apply economic reasoning (not just examples) to justify your answers.
- Explain the “why”, not just the “what”, for every claim you make.

**How to use the AI tutor:**
1) Write your own answer first.
2) Click **Get AI Feedback** and note what you got right or missed.
3) Revise your answer in your notes; be explicit with definitions and causal reasoning.
4) Only then, if needed, reveal the indicative answer below.

**Reflection after you reveal an indicative answer:**
- What did you miss? Where was your reasoning thin?
- Rewrite one stronger sentence that uses an explicit definition + a clear “because”.
