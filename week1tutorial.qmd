## How to use this quiz

This quiz is designed as a **formative self-assessment tool**, not as a test.

Its purpose is to help you:
- check your understanding of the key concepts from Topic 1,
- identify which types of thinking you find more difficult, and
- guide your revision before the tutorial and future assessments.

### What this quiz measures

Each question belongs to one of four categories:

- **Subject Knowledge (SK):** definitions, concepts, and facts.  
- **Analysis (AN):** understanding relationships and economic mechanisms.  
- **Problem Solving (PS):** applying concepts to new situations.  
- **Mathematical Thinking (MT):** working with ratios, prices, and scaling.

Your score will be broken down by category so you can see **where** you are strong and where you need more practice.

### How to complete the quiz

- You may use your notes and the lecture materials.
- Take your time — the goal is understanding, not speed.
- Use the **Hints** if you get stuck.
- You may refresh and retry the quiz as many times as you like.

### How to interpret your results

- A low score is **not a problem** — it tells you what to focus on.
- If you score low in:
  - **SK:** revise definitions and core concepts.
  - **AN:** revisit the logic of the models and examples.
  - **PS:** practise applying concepts to new cases.
  - **MT:** practise the price and ratio calculations.

### About the leaderboard

The leaderboard is optional and anonymous. It exists only to make practice more engaging.  
It has **no effect** on your grade and is not used for evaluation.

The only purpose of this quiz is to support your learning.

**MT5) If $P_A = 2$ and $P_B = 4$, what is the exchange ratio of Apples per Banana?**  
`r webexercises::longmcq(c("0.25", answer = "0.5", "2", "4"))`
<span class="mcq-key" data-correct="0.5"></span>
<details class="hint"><summary>Hint</summary>"Apples per Banana" is the inverse of "Bananas per Apple."</details>

**MT6) An economy has 10 goods. Approximately how many exchange ratios are required without a unit of account?**  
`r webexercises::longmcq(c("10", "25", answer = "45", "100"))`
<span class="mcq-key" data-correct="45"></span>
<details class="hint"><summary>Hint</summary>The number of ratios grows with n², not linearly.</details>

**MT7) If the number of goods doubles from 50 to 100, by approximately what factor does the number of exchange ratios increase?**  
`r webexercises::longmcq(c("It doubles", "It triples", answer = "It quadruples", "It increases tenfold"))`
<span class="mcq-key" data-correct="It quadruples"></span>
<details class="hint"><summary>Hint</summary>Because ratios grow with n², doubling goods quadruples ratios.</details>
